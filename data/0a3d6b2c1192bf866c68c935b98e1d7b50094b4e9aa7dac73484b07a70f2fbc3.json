(after explicitly asking to make sure the food was hot)\n\nCustomer feedback: given the price you charge, make sure food is FRESH AND SERVED HOT.\n\nBut i really do appreciate the head chef and the waiters checking in on us and amending the dishes.\n\nGood service really saved the lunch ðŸ˜Š",

Food: 4/5\nFood is good here especially if you would like to have the sea food. One portion can do a serving for 4 persons easily.\n\n2. Ambience: 4/5\nThe place is situated adjacent to the backwaters. You can see fishermen around, ships crossing the place etc. There will be a little foul smell of fishes but that's how the still backwater is at any place. There's a good DJ playing some nice party songs. It's a loud music party kind of place. They will provide the river side table if available.\n\n3. Service/staff: 4/5\nStaff is courteous, polite and professional. Service time is fine, they can serve everything within 15 minutes even when it is crowded which is good. They are knowledgeable about what they are serving. They check with you about your preferences which is a good thing.\n\nParking: They have got parking for more than 20 cars.\n\nAccesibiliy: Although the place is at ground floor itself, there are small 1-2 steps at entry and inside.\n\nThey also have a small kids playing area with slides and swings.\n\nWashrooms are clean.\n\nReview based on visit in November 2024.",
