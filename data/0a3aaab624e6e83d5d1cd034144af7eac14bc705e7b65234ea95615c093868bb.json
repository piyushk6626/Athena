The Mackerel Fish Fry was fresh and spiced to perfection, while the Sharabi Chicken added a unique twist with its tangy, rum-infused flavor.\n\nFor the main course, the Prawns Thal and Kingfish Thal stole the show. Both came with a complete Goan thali experience, packed with vibrant flavors and fresh ingredients.\n\nTo top it all off, the Mojito and Kokum Sharbat were refreshing and complemented the meal beautifully. Matsya offers an unforgettable seafood dining experience with warm service and a cozy vibe. A must-visit when in Mapusa!",
