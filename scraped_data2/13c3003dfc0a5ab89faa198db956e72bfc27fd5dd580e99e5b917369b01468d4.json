We came for breakfast and ordered English breakfast, Eggs Benedict and coffees.\nThe sausage, ham and bacon were fresh and great to taste.\nThe hollandaise sauce was done very well. The sunny side up was just perfect and had an oozy yolk.\nThe organic marzipan orange was awesome!\nService is great. Ambience is great. If you like continental foods, this is the place to come for that great fresh taste!\nOverall superb! üëç",

We tried their classic english breakfast which was a 5/5.\n\nA burger and smoked chicken pannini each of which was equally wholesome, balanced and delicious. So another 5/5\n\nTheir fresh scones with homemade spread and cream is bound to take you to those english novel eras. That cannot be missed.\n\nIt's also one of the few cafes that clearly mentions allergies and talking to the staff before ordering. Grateful for that.\n\nLastly, don't forget to peek into their dessert section. They make some delicious desserts and many of which are gluten free too.\n\nOverall, it's a must visit place and I'm looking forward forward to visiting it again",
