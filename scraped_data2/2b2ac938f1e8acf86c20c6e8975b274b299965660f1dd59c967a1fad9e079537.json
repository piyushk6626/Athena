Atmosphere is below average as only some tourists or locals might come here. This is not a very happening place like one expects in Goa.",

Yesterday we went there for lunch.\nThe restaurant is right outside St. Cajetan Church.\nWe ordered the fish thali with king fish for 1 and pomfret for the other.\nIt took a little while for the food to arrive. It was hot, freshly prepared and tasty. They also serve green vegetables. Yesterday it was bhendi. Also the tisrio was amazing. The Masala was just right. Not too spicy.\nI would definitely recommend this place for visitors who come to Old Goa.",
