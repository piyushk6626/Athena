Mussels rawa fry was ok.. fish curry was like South indian curry. squid was rubbery..\n\nPork chilly fry: was ok but not flavourful it was like pork tossed with pepper only.\n\nOver the food was not upto mark.. and service is also very poor.\n\nFood: 2/5\nService: 2/5\nAmbience: 4/5\nValue for money: 3/5",

Here’s how I’d rate them:\n\nChicken Lollipop - 4.5/5\nPrawns Butter Garlic - 4.5/5\nPrawns Noodles - 4/5\nPork Vindaloo - 4.5/5\n\nThe food was delicious, the ambiance was pleasant, and the staff was welcoming. The only drawback was the washroom, which wasn’t clean.\n\nOverall, it’s a nice place to dine with family and friends.",

I really like their spicy chicken and prawns butter garlic – it's the best I've ever had. Plus, it's affordable. I definitely suggest checking this place out.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",
