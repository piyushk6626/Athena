The views are absolutely stunning, making it an ideal place to relax and enjoy the evening. Parking is available, but be prepared for a short walk of about 100 meters from the parking area to the restaurant. It's a minor inconvenience, but the beautiful setting more than makes up for it. We ordered the Fish and Chips and the Veg Thai Curry, and both dishes were delicious. The fish was perfectly cooked with a crispy batter, and the Thai curry was flavorful and satisfying. The quality of the food definitely exceeded our expectations. Another great feature is the shower and tap near the beach entrance, which is very convenient for rinsing off after a day at the beach. Overall, Saz on the Beach offers a wonderful dining experience with great food, excellent sunset views, and convenient amenities. It's definitely worth a visit if you're in the area.",

However the whole experience was good, the drinks and food is great. Reducing .5 to 1 point for it being pricey and not offering any deals or offers.\n\nBest for a sundowner, so one should go for that!",
