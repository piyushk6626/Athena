            "review_text": "I visited this outlet for dinner with my family. The ambiance was pleasant—clean and well-maintained. For our meal, we ordered Macaroni Cheese Pasta, Paneer 65, Tandoori Half, Paneer Crispy, and a selection of drinks including Cinderella, Virgin Blue Lagoon, and Heineken. Each item was served at the right temperature, and the presentation was satisfactory. In terms of taste, everything was enjoyable except for the Paneer Crispy. The service was efficient, and the staff were polite. Overall, we had a lovely time. Here’s my detailed review:\n\n- Ambiance: 4/5\n- Cleanliness: 5/5\n- Food Presentation: 3/5\n- Food Temperature: 5/5\n- Taste: 4/5\n- Service Efficiency: 5/5\n- Value for Money: 4/5",

We enjoyed the sunset over excellent fish dishes and sundowners. While in goa, recommend to try kingfish, chonak, tiger prawns etc. Service is excellent and quite fast.",

            "review_text": "During my visit with colleagues, we encountered both positive and negative aspects. The outdoor seating, situated directly on the beach, offers a delightful and picturesque ambiance, conducive to relaxation and enjoyment. However, the indoor setting lacks the same appeal, despite the presence of a commendable music system and a talented DJ.\n\nA piece of advice for prospective guests: it is advisable to request the menu prior to placing an order, in order to be fully informed about the pricing. Regrettably, the presence of stray dogs roaming the area can be somewhat disruptive and detract from the overall experience.\n\nWe sampled a selection of fresh juices, but found them to be excessively diluted, lacking in flavor and concentration. Furthermore, if you are considering ordering the seafood platter, I must caution you that it is exorbitantly priced and does not provide adequate value for the cost.",
