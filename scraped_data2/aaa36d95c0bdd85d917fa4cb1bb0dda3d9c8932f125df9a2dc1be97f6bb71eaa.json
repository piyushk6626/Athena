However, one thing did disappoint me – the guard didn’t allow us to enter from the beach side, citing rules. While I understand rules are important, I kindly request the management to reconsider this policy for the comfort of customers who come directly from the beach. Overall, it was an amazing experience, but this small change could make it even better",

Route is very very very bad dont come in Rainy season. Parking has lot of issues. Entry is very very very strict. They remove your headache pills cigarettes everything even chewing gums even packed. Food is good but very costly. Space is not big. The DJ is good and the performance is great which actually sets the mood and it was fun. Crowd is pathetic now just like Thalassa. Come early by 10 and you ll get a seat and wont be chargeable entry. They are strict but they allow all kind of stags. Service was good and the waiters refuse the tip though there is a HEFTY SERVICE CHARGE on every item.",
