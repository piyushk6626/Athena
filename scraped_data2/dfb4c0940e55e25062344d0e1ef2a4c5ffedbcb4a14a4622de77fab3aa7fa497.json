Service was decent. Food quantity is apt for 2 parole per portion but in terms of taste it could do better. Masala papad portion felt less and sweet lassi ordered wasnâ€™t upto to the mark. Tandoori roti and naan were hot and crispy but the main course could improve. Biryani was decent enough . Have had much better. For the price point it was a decent experience. Bill was approx 1350 and with payment thru zomato it came down to Rs 1250/- which was a bonus.\n\nPlace looked decent on entering and expected a better lunch experience which wasn't the case to be for us.",

Right in the middle of busy candolim, we found everything including pao bhaji, veg thali, stuffed paratha, chhole bhature and variety of icecreams too good to taste and super value for money. Special mention of service from Mr. Sujay for a swift and prompt service with smiling face. Thank you.",
