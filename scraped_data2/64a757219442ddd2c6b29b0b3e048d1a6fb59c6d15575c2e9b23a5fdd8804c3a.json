The atmosphere is ok. Also we have tried one Pinacolada cocktail, which tasted good. Their service is good, but a bit slow. Parking space is very limited. A small approach road leads to the restaurant.",

We just ordered chicken cafreal, and four buns. He said they only have two and we agreed. Later another waiter came and throw 2 more buns to the basket like he gave for free. And he ask us to order drinks and we denied. Then he ask to my face, \"why you come here just for this. No body comes here just for cafreal, you just wasted your time and our time.\" and he also commented how fast we finished our food. Worst experience ever in Goa.",
