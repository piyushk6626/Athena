But had to blindly eat as the lights were switched off and they could not put it back as it was 11.  Must try BBQ chicken wings, stuffed mushrooms and chicken fried rice. And beware about water bottles. They made us buy it even though we did not order nor use it.",

We were also given a table which was positioned in the hot sun and when asked to move a bit they refused. But each place deserves a second chance. So the next time I went (was after a year).\n\nThe sea view is great. The ambiance is amazing. A very chill place to hang out but the food was okayish. Not soo great or good Iâ€™d rather say for the price point. Soo not very happy with it. 3 stars only for the ambiance.",
