I ordered idili, have your ever normal idili is sweet. The thing is the attitude of the waiters they feel that we are having food free or there cost. And they keep the plates or glasses like throwing to the table. Surprisingly they give the food but no palte. While we call the owner he is telling we didn't ask for the plates. The same thing for the water. We didn't ask water that's why they didn't give water and glass. There is one dish royal thali..it has water is complimentary but we ask where is the water, the waiters told there is no water with the dish while we show the menu then only they given the water. The staff and owner are same attitude.\n\nFinally in the photo of the plate attached if you zoom it you can see the stickers in side the plate. That stickers if gone intake they are not care for that.\n\nPlease do not  go even if there is no other hotel near to you.\n\nRegards\nArun",
