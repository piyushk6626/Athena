The moment you arrive, the aroma of freshly baked goods welcomes you, and the friendly staff adds to its old-world charm. Known for its doorstep sales and word-of-mouth popularity, this South Goan bakery focuses on quality over quantity.\n\nHoused in a heritage home, Jila Bakery operates without a typical shop setup—no displays, no seating. The owner takes orders from the veranda, and within moments, you receive your fresh-baked goods and are on your way.\n\nAs for the products, the and a few other items are outstanding. However, the much-hyped éclairs didn’t quite live up to expectations, with a custardy filling that had a strong yolk flavour, not exactly to my taste.",
