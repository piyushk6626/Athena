We went there at sunset time, watched the sunset from the beach and then went to Jamming goat for dinner.\nThere were free tables available around 6:30PM. The staff is very courteous and attentive. The food was plated beautifully, the taste was good but was a little bland. We had to ask for seasoning and chilli flakes with the pasta, for chutney with the kebabs and sauce with tacos. Still, it was a memorable experience. Do visit this place if you are in South Goa.",

The food here is delectable.\n\nThe crab toast is pure bliss. With every bite I kept becoming sad, that ye khatam ho jaayega. I wish I had a limitless tummy and I could just keep eating this. It is seriously that good. The Dahi Papdi Chaat is another kick ass preperation where they have made a foam with curd. It's so light. The mocktails are equally impressive. Everything we ordered was really well prepared. It's a place that you will want to come back to. And I am already waiting for you to go back. Thank you Jamming Goat. You are totally worth it and a must must go to spot when in Goa.",
