In fact, after trying just a small amount, I felt quite nauseous and had to stop eating it altogether. I bought three packets, and regrettably, all of them are now wasted.\n\nI attempted to reach out via phone to provide this feedback directly, but each time I called, the line was busy. Other snacks I bought were not very great.",
