            "review_text": "The restaurant is tucked away in a serene and picturesque location, offering a perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of Goa. This is my personal favourite place, i visit this place every time when in goa.\n\nThe menu features a wide variety of Goan, Indian, and Continental dishes. The seafood is particularly fresh and flavorful, with standout dishes like the prawns curry, fish thali, lepo, modso and king fish. Their vegetarian options, such as the paneer tikka and vegetable biryani, are also excellent.\n\nThe flavors are rich and authentic, making every bite a treat for the taste buds.\n\nService is quick, worth it even if there is some waiting.  The restaurant offers stunning views of the surrounding hills and lush greenery. The first floor seating area is perfect for enjoying a meal while soaking in the natural beauty of Assagao.\n\nDefinitely a must visit place.",

Always wanted to go back and finally when I got there last week it has totally changed in appearance. Seating has increased ten folds. The waiters seemed bored and talk to you in a transactional way. As it is the monsoon season, the variety of seafood available was very limited. We ordered chonak and it was fresh and tasty. Chicken and rice quantity was amazing. The bill was surprisingly low too. We were seated in the section that was more like a hut, also badly lit. However even after all this there were hordes of cars parked outside and people were rushing in even in the heavy down pour.",

            "review_text": "The Hill-View Bar and Restaurant Located in Xeldem, Curchorem locally know as \"Annager\" is a local Goan Restaurant. My friends and I visited this place on Sunday. They serve Goan Food at an affordable price. They have two seating areas one is upstairs which is for couple and family and other is on the ground floor for groups. They have a huge seating area. It's usually crowded during the weekends so the service is slow. They have a good parking area. It is recommended to visit early and give your order at one go and ask them to bring it one at a time. Taste wise food is good. I highly recommend Goan fish curry rice, tisreo and Chicken Tawa.\n\nWe ordered:\nTisreo\nChicken Sukka\nChicken Tawa\nChicken Tandoori\nRice Curry\n\nMust visit place for Local Goan Food",
