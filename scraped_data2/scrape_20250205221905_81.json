While the dishes are flavorful, the staff's attitude leaves much to be desired. The service could definitely use some improvement in terms of friendliness and attentiveness.\n\nOn top of that, hygiene is a serious concern here. I've spotted cockroaches running across the floor during my visit, which raises major doubts about the cleanliness of the kitchen. If you're someone who values hygiene and a clean environment, this might not be the place for you.\n\nIn short, the food may satisfy your cravings, but the poor hygiene and lack of good customer service make it hard to recommend.",
