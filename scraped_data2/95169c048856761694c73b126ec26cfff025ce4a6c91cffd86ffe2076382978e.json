The proprietor of the restaurant is a good man; if you place an order through him, he will ensure that it is proper. However, the staff members are a little odd and unfocused. Prices are on the upper end.",

The food was terrible—bland, poorly cooked, and clearly not fresh. It wasn’t just us; other guests around us were visibly upset with the service and food quality. The overall atmosphere was unwelcoming, and it ruined what should have been an enjoyable day. I would strongly advise avoiding this place—definitely not worth your time or money.\n\nIf there was an option for a zero star they deserve it.",
