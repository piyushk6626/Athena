The traditional Rajasthani vegetarian food served here is simply outstanding. Each dish is bursting with authentic flavors and made with the finest ingredients, offering a true taste of Rajasthan. From the delicious dal baati churma to the mouthwatering gatte ki sabzi, every item on the menu is a treat for the senses. The service was impeccable, and the ambiance added to the warm, welcoming feel of the restaurant. It was a wonderful dining experience for our entire family, and we left completely satisfied.

            "review_text": "If you’re in North Goa and craving an authentic Rajasthani dining experience, Ghoomar is a must-visit gem. This restaurant brings the rich flavors of Rajasthan to life, with every dish crafted to perfection. The dal and kadhi were truly exceptional, capturing that signature Rajasthani taste. The halwa was a highlight—perfectly sweet and full of traditional warmth. While all the items were delightful, the churma was the only one that didn’t quite match the high standards set by the rest of the meal.\n\nThe restaurant offers a great ambiance that makes you feel like you’re dining in the heart of Rajasthan. Plus, the prices are very reasonable for the quality and quantity of food provided. Convenient parking is available, which is a bonus in Goa.\n\nFor anyone looking to indulge in delicious, authentic Rajasthani cuisine, Ghoomar is a culinary experience not to be missed.",
