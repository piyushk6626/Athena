I also indulged in a delicious pizza that was cooked to perfection.\n\nThe atmosphere was electric thanks to the amazing music playing throughout the evening. The service was top-notch, with friendly and attentive staff. I was even fortunate enough to meet the owner, who was incredibly welcoming and made sure I had a memorable experience.\n\nI would wholeheartedly recommend Baba's little Italy to anyone looking for a fantastic dining experience, whether you prefer vegetarian options or enjoy non-vegetarian dishes. It's a must-visit!",

Both dishes were very well presented and tasted amazing.  The staff are very friendly and the selection on the menu is very wide - should satisfy all tastes.  They have a pizza oven - and their pizzas looked good.  Definitely worth stopping here if youâ€™re in the area.",
