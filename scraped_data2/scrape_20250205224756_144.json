Unfortunately there was no offer on Swiggy, but Zomato had. (Actually no difference Swiggy guy come in Zomato ka scooter most of the time).\n\nWe ordered for Chizza, (a decade back when it was newly introduced I was due hard fan of it, it was completely melted cheese, currently they have put their wings/popcorn (whatever all taste same with some different in quantity of malasa) and I would say it‚Äôs okay okay now). When open its shape was distorted.\nWe had ordered for Meal combo with Pepsi. Idk what‚Äôs in that Pepsi so much caffeine I slept soo late after Consuming it that night. Two rolls were average though. And wings. Along with wings had some offer of 1 free item. They had mixed it in same box. Chicken Burger Zinger was plain plain. Like at half of this rate I would have gotten 3 burger that too filled with all sauces. Overall I would say all the things are average but somehow I feel like eating it more. Even now while writing my mouth watering. And mind saying Bhookh laagla ani zay but pocket saying, naaka. It‚Äôs freaking expensive. Believe me KFCs food is a hypnosis.",
