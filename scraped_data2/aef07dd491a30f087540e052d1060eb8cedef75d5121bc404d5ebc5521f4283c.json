We started with French Fries, Pepper Chicken, and Dragon Chicken as startersâ€”all were perfectly cooked and very tasty. For the main course, we tried the Biryani, which was a bit spicy but full of flavor, and the Chicken Fried Rice, which was excellent. To complement the meal, we had Lemon Soda, which was refreshing and delicious. The service was exceptionalâ€”waiters were well-trained, very quick, and attentive. Overall, a great place for a tasty and enjoyable dining experience!",

Am always concerned about how my parents would enjoy the food, this place was not worried at all.\n\nWe had a wonderful mix of starters - Chicken (not sure on the name), the staff helped us by recommending it and was happy as it was a mix of mild spice and a little more spice.\n\nThe Butter chicken and the naan took the cake. My dad actually ordered another plate just to take home and enjoy it... Absolute knock out.\n\nWe had a Veg thali which was filled with lovely Veg assorted and a chicken thali.\n\nFood was good. Ambience was stellar. A mix of goan music and hindi music played. We met a Politician from dad's village too on the day we\nvisited which was a plus plus ðŸ™‚.\n\nDon't hesitate to try this place out if you are in Panjim.\n\nThank you Masak team, keep up your stellar work.",
