However, the cost is a little bit on the higher side.\n\nYou may have a wait time of 20 minutes depending on the number of people and weekends or weekdays.\n\nThe ambiance was awesome for lunch, feels airy even in full occupied in the month of December.\n\nVeg food is really good in taste. I choose to eat jira rice with panner tikka masala instead of fish curry.\n\nRecommended: Chonak rawa fry, surmai rawa fry, solkadi, paneer tikka masala\n\nYou need to always ask for service to serve. They could improve there",
