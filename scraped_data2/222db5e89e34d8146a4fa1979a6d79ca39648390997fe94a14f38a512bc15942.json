I would avoid the Apple Pie - as many times as I have had it, it's been uncooked unfortunately. Their in-house coconut ice cream is really good. Must try. Overall it's a great place with decent pricing. Alcohol is available. It's good to go with family friends or on a date. Service is great.",

They played R&B and jazz music all the while. Staff had a proper uniform and were quick and courteous.\nHowever the food was delicious.\nThe Menu is quiet extensive.\nWe ordered Barbeque chicken wings, which was yummy. The big crab Rechead Masala (600) was spicy & had tears rolling down my cheek, enjoyed it.\nThe chicken Steak sizzler was good as was the Fish & chips (500) , crispy & less oily.\nHowever, we absolutely loved the Quail Soup (220). It was an absolute meal in itself & was very flavourful and well prepared. Highly recommended.\nOur bill for four came upto around 3k including 3 mocktails.",
