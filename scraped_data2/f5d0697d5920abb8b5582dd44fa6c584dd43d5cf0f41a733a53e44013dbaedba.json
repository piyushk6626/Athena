From the moment you step in, you’re greeted with a pleasant ambiance that caters to both AC and non-AC seating preferences, ensuring comfort for every guest.\n\nThe Chole Bhature is an absolute standout—fluffy bhature paired with perfectly spiced chole that will leave your taste buds craving more. Equally delightful were the strawberry ice creams and shakes, which made for the perfect dessert to end the meal.\n\nEvery dish we tried was a hit, showcasing the restaurant’s consistency in flavour and quality. The service was also good, further enhancing the dining experience. Bonus points for having ample parking space, a rarity in Goa!\n\nOverall, it’s a fantastic spot for pure veg cuisine with great food, excellent service, and a cozy ambiance. Highly recommended!",
