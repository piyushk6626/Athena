The staff is generally helpful, but you can tell the spirit of this place is more focused on making money rather than creating a memorable dining experience. Unfortunately, this reflects in the quality of the food – it’s okay to eat, but nothing stands out to make you want to return. The quality-to-price ratio leaves something to be desired.",

Near our hotel, went with jolly mood and got a nice seat. No doubt it would look studio ghibli movie kinda in daylight. Now, how the experience transitioned that matters too. We were greeted and served by a waiter whose energy was off and a bit negative. He suggested white sauce with black pepper. I especially wanted proper spicy steak with sautéed veggies. I know how to cook it so I’ll list down a few points. The mashed potatoes had lumps, the veggies were boiled even when we asked for sautéed ones. There was one breast with not even enough veggies. The service is quick but they can take their time to deliver best. Overall, the vibe is great. The live music adds to it and the menu is diverse. However, the prices are high. The smoothie was delicious but again had to ask for ice. The ice made smoothie better. I would wanna go again and won’t like the same waiter to dilute our experience. We met him thrice and every-time his energy was off which ruined our mood too. Must go and explore!",
