Ordered a goan fish thali and a plate of King fish which they offer as an add-on to the thali and not individually.\nAfter placing the order you have to wait for 15-20 minutes as food is prepared fresh. Food was good and flavour full. Light on stomach but filling. I even asked for extra curry and was provided free of cost.\nOnly complaint is regarding the thickness of the fish but still manageable. Price is nominal as compared to what restaurants are charging in Goa.\n\nThey were playing old hindi movie songs from 70s which were very soothing. The setup is very basic and nothing fancy but clean and maintained. Plastic tables and chairs. This place is really popular and gets filled up in no time and sometimes even run out of fish so its better to call before going.\n\nParking is a challenge and they don't allow drinking alcohol or smoking inside their premises.",
