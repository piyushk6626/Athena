The Kum Pao chicken was also good, tangy taste with cashewnuts.\nBut the highlight was the sushi. The dragon roll sushi which we had was AWESOME, the whole myriad of individual flavors came together well to give a real treat to the taste buds. Would definitely recommend this (and also their prawn tempura sushi).\n\nFor dessert we had the cheesecake which was really AMAZING. And the caramel pudding was good as well.\n\nA great place to have a comforting meal.",
