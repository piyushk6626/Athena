The red boiled rice served to us was undercooked - except that all dishes were spot on and the quantity is also big enough for two to share\nA small garden in front makes you feel that you are not in the city but in a quiet remote place\nGood place for the local cuisine",

We loved the rice and King fish curry.\n\nWhen we went on a Friday afternoon, it was completely empty. Although we had taken a reservation via phone. Staff were friendly and ambience was good. Food was a bit expensive which we realised only after spending couple of days in Goa.\n\nDefinitely visit once for the Ambience, hospitality and the food taste.",

I would rate the food 7/10.\n\nAnything except main course is a very small quantity for the price. A bit disappointed with all the hype and the result. Please do come here but not with a super big expectation in terms of taste or ambience.\n\nI made a reservation online which was for 600. When I walked in, it was empty. So I do understand there is a lot of fomo going on about this place but don't be overwhelmed when you call on customer care and they say it's only by reservations. You can simply walk in too.",
