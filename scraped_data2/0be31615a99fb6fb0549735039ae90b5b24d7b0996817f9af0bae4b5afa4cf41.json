I have been coming here for last 10 years and never disappointed by their Chonak Fish Thali. Mr. Bhaskar Shetty (Manager) is as hospitable as always serving with big smile. However, this time around we had a very bad experience with one of their waiter who is bald. He was extremely rude to all of our queries regarding fish availability and freshness before placing the order, gave weird looks to us and spoilt the entire experince for us due to his rude attitude. Will never come to this place again to see this person for how badly he treated us during our entire meal time and rather visit Ritz's other outlet.",

We were literally pissed off standing so much, however, just because this has that go authentic food so we waited long.\nWe ordered crab garlic, which was very good and tasted also, nice.\nI like too much the fish curry, which was so good to have with the rice. The caramel pudding was not that great, but yeah, fine to eat one time. The soul kadi is must try.",
