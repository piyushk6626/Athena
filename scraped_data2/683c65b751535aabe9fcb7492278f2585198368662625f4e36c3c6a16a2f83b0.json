So here is the review:\n\nStaff🧒: Prompt and responsive😊 staff as servers and cleaners✨ with table service\nInterior💺:  That can accommodate easily 50 people🎎.. Nice marble tables with firm steel seatings that are always clean...With fans for ventilations and has a separate AC room too that can take a out 20people 😅\nParking🚗: Public parking infront of the restaurant🛣️ which is easier for 2 wheelers🏍️ but not for cars🚗...they will need to park across the road somewhere... Depends on rush hour traffic too🚦\nTimings⌚: Opens early at 8am and closes by 10pm with no lunchtime break.. timings may vary sometimes 😅\nRestaurant🏪: Contains  mostly freshly prepared hot♨️ South🍛 Indian food items like Dosa🥞, Idlis🍙,Vadas🥔, Puri with many Bhaji options🍪😊that are good for taste and very affordable 💵 too... It also has Veg thalis🍛 in the afternoon time between 1pm to 2pm.. Serves a lot of hot beverages too☕ like tea coffee ☕ and other coolers🍹...It also has a juice counter🍇🍉🍋🍊 ... It has Chaat and other items in the evenings🌇 after 4pm...Try their Dahi shev Puri that is available after 4pm😋\nPricing💵: Reasonably priced and affordable 🥞 for its location\nCrowd: Local and mostly college students and employees from nearby👨‍🏭👷‍♀️👷‍♂️\n\nUsually it is a busy place any time of the day or night... At the most people halt for 30mins max... People drop by all the time for breakfast, lunch and dinner🙂... The rest can be seen in the photos attached below😅",
