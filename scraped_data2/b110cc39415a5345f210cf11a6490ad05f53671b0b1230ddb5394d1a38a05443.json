Ended the meal with a Serradora (goan dessert) which could have been better, but no complaints!! A definite recommend amongst the hoardes of restaurants that have sprung up of late.",

The service was top-notch – our server was attentive, friendly, and made sure we had everything we needed.\nThe bar had a great selection of drinks, and we enjoyed. The live music was the perfect touch – the boy (Rudraksh_music) was incredibly talented and created such a lively atmosphere.\nWe had an unforgettable time and will definitely be back soon! Highly recommend.",
