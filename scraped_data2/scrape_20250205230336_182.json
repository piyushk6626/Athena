Food is really good and is a must try if you want to avoid overly crowded Copperleaf.\n\nDon't appreciate the menu leaflets attached to the paper clipboard, it can do better.\nServers were friendly and explained the different gravies well.",

The dum biryani was also impressive. To complement our meal, we had the green apple mocktail, which was good but a bit too sweet for my taste. Overall, a great dining experience!",
