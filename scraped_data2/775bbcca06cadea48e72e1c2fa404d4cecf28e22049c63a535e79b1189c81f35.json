            "review_text": "I recently visited this restaurant and had an interesting experience. The menu was limited, but it featured fresh, homegrown herbs and aromatics from their kitchen garden, which added a unique touch. While I didn’t try the cocktails, the cocktail menu looked quite appealing and creative. The place is on the expensive side and they do levy a 10% service charge, which might be a consideration for some. There's ample parking, which is a plus.\n\nAs for the food, it didn’t quite have the \"wow\" factor I was hoping for, but all the dishes were healthy and gut-friendly, with a focus on nutritious ingredients. The staff was attentive and well-informed about the menu, providing a pleasant dining experience.\n\nOverall, it’s worth a visit for those looking for a healthy, unique dining experience, but for me, it’s more of a one-time visit.",

The menu is small, but everything they serve is so fresh and natural—it’s like they put extra care into each dish. The flavors are simple but rich, and you can tell the ingredients are top-notch. It's not a place for a huge variety, but what they do, they do really well. Definitely a spot worth visiting if you’re craving something light, tasty, and wholesome!",

Will recommend The tea leaf salad as it has so many unique texture and layers to the dish. I also appreciated that they deshell the crab so throughly for the curry crab dish! there is only alfresco dining so it may get warm in the day but they have tried to add as many fans around the tables. Service was warm and prompt. Overall we had an enjoyable dining experience here.",
