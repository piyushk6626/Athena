From the chicken croissant to the bagel, everything was fresh and flavorful. Don’t miss their crafted chocolates and ice cream—especially the caramel ice cream, which was simply out of this world.\n\nThe staff were friendly and attentive, though the service was a bit slow. We had to wait over 35 minutes for our order to be served.\n\nAll in all, it’s a great spot to relax and enjoy some truly tasty food.",

We have visited this place a couple of times during our stay in Goa and it did not disappoint. We had the English breakfast, coffee, pastries, tea, juice, fries, gelato and other exciting items. They were really good!",

Trusting the buzz on Google, we decided to give it a go.\n\nThe café ambiance was charming, radiating a relaxed vibe that makes it perfect for unwinding or a casual hangout. The décor was thoughtfully designed, adding a cozy touch that was both inviting and stylish. We ordered a mocha and a hot chocolate, and both drinks impressed us with their quality—smooth, rich, and flavorful. The mocha was perfectly brewed, and the hot chocolate had that luxurious creaminess that’s hard to beat.\n\nHowever, while the quality was spot-on, the prices seemed on the higher side. For the portion sizes, it felt a bit steep, though perhaps that’s the trade-off for the premium ingredients and chic vibe.\n\nAll in all, NANBAI was a pleasant experience—a great spot for a delicious dessert or a quality coffee break. While a tad over-rated in our opinion, it’s certainly worth a visit for anyone looking to experience an upscale café in Panjim.",
