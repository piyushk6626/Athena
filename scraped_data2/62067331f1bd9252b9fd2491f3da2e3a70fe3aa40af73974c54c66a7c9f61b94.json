The atmosphere is relaxing, and the food is both soulful and satisfying.\n\nThe menu features some standout dishes that come highly recommended. The Tandoori Prawns and Rawa Fried Mussels are particularly noteworthy, bursting with flavor. The Chicken Handi and Pork Chops also deliver great taste and quality. Additionally, tried other items on the menu, which were all really lovely.\n\nDon‚Äôt miss the Tangdi Kebab‚Äîit‚Äôs an absolute must-try and a highlight of the meal.\nFor a memorable dining experience by the river with fantastic food, this place is definitely worth a visit.",

Other then that the food was hideousü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Chicken lollipops were tough n burnt. Very hard to bit on. Had to return the order. Food  took long to leave the kitchen given the fact it wasn‚Äôt busy at all.  Fried rice was dry and tasteless so was the garlic bread. The only dish that please me was garlic-chili beef tongue.\nThe server didn‚Äôt provide prompt service. Overall restaurant experience was unsatisfactory.",
