I was supposed to eat at another famous restaurant in neighbourhood (let‚Äôs call it ‚ÄòK.C‚Äô for reference üôÉ) but that had a huge waiting plus I had been there before so I decided to wander around and now I‚Äôm glad I did as I found this. They serve the staple fish thali and have other dishes too on the menu, all being decently priced. I hope they improve on their options for beers though, as currently they have only two on the menuüôÅ. Also you may have to reconsider if you accompanied by a group as the seating is fairly limited.",

A small and cozy setting, the thalis here are fantastic and worth every rupee.\n\nThe ambience is very homely and cute. They have many interesting posters on the walls.",
