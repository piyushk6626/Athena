However, occasionally the fish isn't as fresh as I'd like. One of my favorite items from the thali is the pineapple sausav, which is delicious. Their chicken dishes are also worth trying – well-dressed and flavorful. The staff is friendly, and the vibe is quite nice. Be prepared for a wait during the afternoons, especially on weekends. On the downside, the washroom could be cleaner, and parking is a bit tricky. Overall, it's a satisfying experience.",
