The location is perfect for enjoying a beach view while dining.\nWe visited the upatairs floor and tried vegetarian food of navarthna veg and were impressed. We ordered veg handi, daal, jeera rice, and paneer jalfrezi, and all the dishes were delicious. The restrooms were also clean and well-maintained.",

The service was good and one can enjoy sea while eating. This place does not have AC but big coolers and sea breeze also could be enjoyed. For lunch we ordered 2 kulcha, 2 naan, 1 chicken vindaloo and 1 egg fried rice. The total bill was 935/-. Kulchas did not have stuffings because we know that generally kulchas have stuffings. Moreover the size of the kulchas were small comparing to other restaurents. For dinner, we took 1 chicken 65, 1 chicken lollypop, 1 mix noodles and 2 bottles of turbourg large. Mix noodle was not upto the mark especially according to price. Others's taste were more than average. Live music was playing so one who cannot bear high sound could feel bothered but we enjoyed it.\nThe major dissapointment was 2 bottles of drink were charged 180 per bottle where printed price was 110. Then they also took 22% VAT. I have never seen any goaneese restaurent is taking VAT on liquor. The total bill amount was 1355.\nPositive side of the restaurent were their view of the sea and their staff Jhuma who was taking utmost care of the guests.",
