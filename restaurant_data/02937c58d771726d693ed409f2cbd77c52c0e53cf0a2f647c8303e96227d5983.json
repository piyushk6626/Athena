Ordered Calamari Butter Garlic, it was cooked to perfection and the butter garlic sauce was perfect. The next dish was Goan fish curry and steamed rice. They used sea bass in fish curry. Fish curry rice was extremely spicy. Thats my fault cause he asked if i wanted it spicy or less spicy. My reply was let it be as authentic it can be. Ended up with a very spicy fish curry.",

The staff was prompt and attentive. The food was served quite fast. I like the rawa fried prawns, chicken Kadai....and the rotis were nice & crispy. However, the prawns curry with rice could have been better. Will surely visit next time if i pass by Morjim. Until then, have a wonderful experience travellers!! Viva‚úåüèª",
