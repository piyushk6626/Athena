The food options on the menu are limited and the food quality isn't spectacular either. The price is also a bit on the higher end.\n\nOn the positive end, the live music is good and sports screening is also available. They have a wide variety of pan options available as desserts which can be tried. Overall, it's a pretty decent family place but passable in case you have better options.",
