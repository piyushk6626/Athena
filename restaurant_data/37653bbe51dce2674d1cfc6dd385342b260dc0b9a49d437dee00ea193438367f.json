Comparing the quantity and quality with other available options nearby, this restaurant is far better than anyone.\nBehaviour of the staffs are excellent and response is also professional. The pricing of food is also very much affordable.\nThe only factor I've observed is it's seating capacity is not sufficient according to demand and number of customers incoming. Thus, always a waiting crowd may be seen during the peak hours.\nApart from this, like more other restaurants nearby, this place doesn't have any designated parking place available. The vehicles are to be parked on street on owner's own risk.\nBut, if you crave for some veg delicacies under pocket friendly budget, I would definitely recommend this place to visit once.",

            "review_text": "So a friend of mine randomly remembered this place where he had eaten this AMAZING paratha in 2008. Didn't remember anything but the taste of the paratha from back then. We googled the best paratha in Vasco, and this was one of the first places. We saw the photos and narrowed them down because this looked the best.\n\nWhen my friend had the first bite, he knew this was the place we were looking for! Such is the taste of this place that everyone remembered it after 15-odd years!\n\nThe place is generally open very late, till 11 o'clock. There are two sittings, one non-ac on the ground floor and AC on the first floor.\nThey have takeaways as well, which probably comprise most of their orders. This can mean the service is slow, but that's not the case here. The staff is active, and the small kitchen on the first floor makes getting smaller things out quickly possible. But but, we've seen the waiter get lost and forget which table ordered the fried rice. So that was a meh.\n\nWe ordered the classic Aloo Paratha, which they serve hot with curd. We also ordered Matar Paneer because it was too late to eat curd. The paratha was stuffed and was more than enough for one person's meal. The matar paneer tasted really good as well.\nNot sure if the AC/non-AC sitting has different prices, but the price was really affordable for the taste and the service in the AC section as well.\n\nOverall, it was a great experience, mainly because of the story my friend had with the place. But kudos to the restaurant for not disappointing!\nWould definitely recommend it for lunch/dinner if you like parathas.",

    "description": "### Kashi Dairy Veg Restaurant Review\n\nNestled in the heart of Bogmalo, Kashi Dairy Veg Restaurant has garnered a commendable rating of 3.8 from a bustling community of 926 reviewers. This charming eatery is celebrated for its delectable vegetarian options and is particularly known for its aloo paratha and lassi, with both dishes drawing equal adoration from 21 patrons each. Other fan favorites include the samosas, with 18 mentions, underscoring the restaurant's expertise in creating comforting Indian staples.\n\n#### Ambiance & Design\n\nUpon entering Kashi Dairy, diners are greeted by a cozy yet bustling atmosphere. The restaurant features a split seating arrangement: a lively air-conditioned area on the first floor and a more laid-back non-AC section on the ground floor. The decor strikes a balance between simplicity and functionality, with clean lines and bright lighting that keeps the space vibrant. The walls are adorned with tasteful local artwork, which adds character to the dining experience. Informal seating may make it feel crowded during peak hours, as many reviewers have noted, but the ambiance remains warm and welcoming. \n\nSounds of sizzling pans and friendly chatter create a lively backdrop, enhanced by the gentle melodies played softly in the background, making it an ideal spot for friends and family gatherings.\n\n#### Menu & Culinary Experience\n\nThe menu at Kashi Dairy is strictly vegetarian and one that showcases many beloved Indian dishes. Signature offerings include the **classic aloo paratha**, served piping hot alongside creamy curd. The paratha, distinctively stuffed to generous proportions, has become a nostalgic dish for many diners, reminiscent of flavors from their past. Another standout is the **chole bhature**, which many claim to be an excellent choice, paired perfectly with the bready bhature. \n\nReviewers are also enthusiastic about the **samosas**, which, despite being smaller in size relative to price, manage to pack a flavorful punch. One must not miss the **lassi**, hailed as a must-try drink to accompany the meal, adding a refreshing touch with its cool creaminess. Although opinions diverge on the massala dosa and some other dishes, the overall presentation is pleasing, with bright colors and enticing aromas appealing to the senses. \n\nFor those seeking a lighter snack, the quick-service takeaway option ensures dishes come out timely, even when the restaurant gets busy, though occasionally service may suffer due to the influx of customers.\n\n#### Customer Experience & Service\n\nThe customer experience at Kashi Dairy is notably positive, with reviews consistently praising the excellent behavior and professional responsiveness of the staff. While challenges may arise, such as occasionally slower service during peak times, many guests express appreciation for the attentiveness of the staff. Reservation policies appear flexible, often accommodating walk-in guests, but it's wise to visit earlier or later in the day to avoid long waits, particularly on weekends.\n\nNevertheless, it is important to note that parking may be a concern, as designated spaces are unavailable, prompting patrons to seek on-street parking at their own risk.\n\n#### Popularity & Reviews\n\nKashi Dairy maintains a robust presence across social media platforms, with many customers sharing their experiences and mouth-watering food photos, contributing to its popularity. The restaurant draws a diverse crowd of locals and tourists alike, all united by a shared love for great vegetarian food at wallet-friendly prices. The engaging stories behind many reviews, combined with the heartwarming atmosphere, create a compelling narrative that invites future visitors to explore.\n\n#### Utilizing Visual Content\n\nThe vibrant images shared by patrons beautifully capture the essence of Kashi Dairy. The enticing sight of golden-brown aloo parathas, served steaming hot, juxtaposed against the creamy backdrop of lassi, reflects the richness and tradition that resonates throughout the menu. Another image showcases the warm, inviting setting of the restaurant, with patrons enjoying their meals within its cozy walls—evidence of a dining experience that resonates beyond just the food.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Kashi Dairy Veg Restaurant in Bogmalo is a delightful destination for anyone seeking satisfying vegetarian fare. The combination of authentic flavors, a lively atmosphere, and friendly service makes it an experience worth savoring. Whether you’re a local resident or a traveler passing through, this restaurant promises a comforting meal that leaves a lasting impression.",
