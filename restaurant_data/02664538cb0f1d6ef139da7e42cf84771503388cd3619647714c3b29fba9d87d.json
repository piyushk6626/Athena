The ambience is also amazing, everything is very colourful and aesthetic. Now coming to the food. The food wasn’t the best but it wasn’t the worst either. It was average. I feel it didn’t live up to the price. Specially the sardar chicken . I found it too dry and a little tasteless. The food is not exactly how you expect North Indian food to taste. But the service and the ambience makes it worth the visit.",
