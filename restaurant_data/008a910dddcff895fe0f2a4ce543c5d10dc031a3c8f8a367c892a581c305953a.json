The food was outstanding, with each dish we tried being of the highest quality and bursting with flavor.\n\nThe five spiced vegetables dish was perfectly cooked and full of flavor, The pulled chicken korean bao is a must-try and was fabulous! For dessert, the brownie and ice cream were fantastic‚Äîespecially with the generous portion of ice cream.\n\nI highly recommend this place and will definitely be back soon to out more dishes.

The momos were super spicy for my husband and MIL so they were kind enough to take the remaining back and adjust the sauce.\n\nOnly it took a really long time for them to send out my husband‚Äôs drink which was basically a thumbs up float with vanilla ice cream and we had to remind them at least 3 times. My MIL and I had mocktails that were more complicated to make and they came out right away.\n\nThey played good music, mostly covers of popular songs. We had a good laugh hearing Linkin Park‚Äôs ‚ÄúNumb‚Äù being played to a dance beat.\n\nThe seating is fun and creative, with an outdoor section with a swing bench.",
