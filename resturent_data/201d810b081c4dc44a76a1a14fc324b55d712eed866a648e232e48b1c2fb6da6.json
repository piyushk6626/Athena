There is ample parking space and the setting attracts your attention with dazzling lights. The food was priced decently, with some items being costly while most others being fairly priced. Tried the mackerel fish which was OK. The Prawns 65 didn't have the '65' punch but was decent. White sauce pasta was great and crispy veg was delicious. The restaurant has enough options for both veg and non-veg people. The service was a bit slow but the ambience made up for it. If you are near Colva, this is a must place to go.",

The lively atmosphere makes it worth visiting, even if not every dish is a hit. A great spot to soak in the local energy and enjoy the experience!",
