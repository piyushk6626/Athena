The flavors were authentic, and the food was well-prepared, earning it a solid 8/10. However, the dining atmosphere left room for improvement. The restaurant was quite noisy, which made it difficult to enjoy the meal fully, and there were flies on our table, which was unpleasant. While the food is definitely worth trying, better attention to cleanliness and ambiance would elevate the overall experience",
