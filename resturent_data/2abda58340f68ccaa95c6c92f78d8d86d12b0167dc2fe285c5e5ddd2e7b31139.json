Good variety of cocktails and mocktails. The special Thali is something worthwhile and filling. Had a good time in a long while.",

Grilled shrimps, Madagascar prawns something like thermidor prawns it was nice. Southern fried chicken it was crispy and cheese garlic fries. Red velvet ice-cream.\n\nYou won't be disappointed,  hospitable staff although service was bit slow cos everything is prepared fresh.\n\nThey have a another place in Porvorim near the court will try as we were told some dishes which are served there are not served at this joint n vice-versa.\n\nAmbience 3/5\nHospitality 4/5\nFood 4/5\nPrice 4/5\n\nWill visit one more time after visiting Porvorim joint.",

Warm ambience.\n\nWe had squid butter garlic (creamy and tasty).\n\nThe coriander chicken was juicy, succulent and delicious (and I don't use these three words together often). Was really good.\n\nFor dessert we wanted darsan with ice cream, which was sold out. Turned out to be a blessing for us because they recommended their home churned red velvet cake ice cream, which blew our minds away. It was really heavenly and a great way to end the day!! Would highly recommend it.\n\nA pleasant dining experience!!",
