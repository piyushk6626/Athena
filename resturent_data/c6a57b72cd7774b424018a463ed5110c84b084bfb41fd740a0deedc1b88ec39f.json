            "review_text": "Savor Restaurant and Bar - A Mixed Experience\n\nI recently visited Savor Restaurant and Bar and had an overall decent experience. The ambiance was pleasant with cozy interiors and soft lighting, perfect for a casual dining experience. However, the service was a bit slow, with staff being friendly but not very attentive, leading to delays in both ordering and receiving the food.\n\nThe menu offered a variety of dishes, and while some of the items were flavorful, others felt a bit underwhelming. The appetizers were well-prepared, but the main courses lacked consistency in terms of taste and presentation. The drinks menu was fairly extensive, but the cocktails didn‚Äôt stand out as much as I had hoped.\n\nWhile Savor has potential, improvements in service speed and food quality would greatly enhance the dining experience. It‚Äôs a decent spot for a casual night out, but it may not be the best choice for those looking for something extraordinary.",
