We ordered cheese garlic naan ( one of the best I have had ) it was stuffed with a lot of cheese. Crispy Chicken and fried rice were average. The waiters dint pay any attention to us even when the place was almost empty. We told them to clean our table so many times and then someone cleant it after 10-15 minutes. This place had ample seating and a  attached pub.",
