The steaks are incredibly juicy, cooked to perfection, and the toppings they offer take the flavor to another level. You really can’t go wrong here!\n\nI always heard my friend rave about this place, and I honestly thought he was exaggerating. But after my visit, I can confidently say he was spot on! The price point is just perfect, giving you great quality without compromising on taste.\n\nAnd let’s not forget about their piña colada—it’s fantastic! It’s the perfect refreshing drink to accompany your meal. I seriously want to come here every day! If you’re looking for a great grill house experience, this is the place to be. Highly recommended!",

Their beek steak in red wine sauce is amazing but for a change we also ordered a beef steak in chimichuri sauce. This one is a must try for all spice lovers. We also ordered chilly garlic prawns which we would highly recommend.\nVisited this place again and tried their fish steak in crab sauce. This one is a must try.",
