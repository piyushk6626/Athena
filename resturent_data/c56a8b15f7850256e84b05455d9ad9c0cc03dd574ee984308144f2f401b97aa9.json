It’s just a mess for having a tummy full meal at a reasonable price.\n\nThe seating was ordinary but the waiter was spot in taking the order and  the food arrived in a jiffy. The food tasted like home cooked food but I have had better tasted meals in the past.\n\nWe were in a hurry and this actually did justice to our requirement. Not something I would recommend for tourists. Best suited for folks working in and around the area",
