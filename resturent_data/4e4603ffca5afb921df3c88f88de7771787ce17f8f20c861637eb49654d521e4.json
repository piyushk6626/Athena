Itâ€™s great the place is still in business. The food was really good. The idlis and the coconut chutney were the bomb. The idli has so unique fermented rice flavor and so fluffy spongy and the chutney is fresh grated coconut and spices, not sweet at all which is the best part. Full of flavor! The mix veg khorma was also great. And the special tea was super fresh and flavorful. Loved it. Puri was fluffy and delicious! The cheese masala dosa was amazing with lots of amul cheese and the potato masala inside was perfect blend of spices and deliciousness. Everything costed $2.77!",

I would recommend people to be very persistent with what you need. Because the waiters here seem exhausted and frustrated to simply wait and listen to take down your order. I'm very much disappointed with the service.",
