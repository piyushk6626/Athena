The food was delicious, and the highlight for me was their tandoori dishes—perfectly cooked, flavorful, and with just the right amount of spice. It’s clear they’ve mastered the art of tandoori cooking.\n\nAnother standout was the fish fry—crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and incredibly fresh. The quality of the fish and the variety of choices available were impressive. You can tell they prioritize using fresh ingredients, which really makes a difference.\n\nThe overall ambiance was warm and inviting, and the service was friendly and attentive. Whether you’re craving tandoori specialties or fresh seafood, Ben and Sand is definitely worth a visit!",

Prices very affordable- not the tourist hiked up rates.  This place is also frequented by the locals\n\nService is good but it takes about 10 to 15 minutes for your off beat dishes to be served .\n\nAmbience is good\nParking plenty on the road",
