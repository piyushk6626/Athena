The star of my recent visit was their chicken tikka biryani â€“ a masterful creation that ranks among the finest I've tasted. The fragrant long-grain rice was perfectly cooked, each grain separate and fluffy, while the chicken tikka pieces were succulent and infused with a complex blend of spices.\n\nWhile the industrial estate location might seem unconventional for a restaurant, the quality of the food makes Mom's Kitchen well worth seeking out, especially for biryani enthusiasts.",

Must try is chicken biriyani and mixed fried rice... Quantity is a lot!! Better to take 1 for 2 persons!! Bit on the expensive side but it's definitely worth it.... Would easy recommend this for everyone!!",
