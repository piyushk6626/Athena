I mean what are you doing in the hospitality business if you can't find a decent tone to speak to the customer.\nI won't even go to the details of food. It was average I won't categorise it bad or good average you can find at ant restaurant.\nBut the staff don't know how to make a straight face or smile at a customer, Initially I thought one of there staff named \"JIMMY\" was rude later found out many of the are like that.\nWouldn't recommend at all.",
