            "review_text": "Time of Visit: Around 5pm\nI recently visited this popular spot, hoping for a delightful dining experience. While the ambiance and service were pleasant, the food unfortunately didn’t meet expectations.\n\nAmbiance & Atmosphere: The interior is well designed and clean with plenty of space, creating a stylish yet comfortable atmosphere. It was calm during my visit, which made for a relaxing setting.\n\nService: Service was efficient and polite. The staff were attentive, but the experience didn’t stand out in a way that made me feel particularly special.\n\nWhat I Ordered: Fish Fry, Chicken Xacuti, and Pao, my hope was for bold, flavorful dishes.\n\nFood Review: Unfortunately, the flavors didn’t live up to the hype. The Fish Fry was underwhelming and lacked the punch I expected, while the Chicken Xacuti, usually a rich and aromatic dish, felt surprisingly flat. I’m not sure if I just picked the wrong items, but the overall taste didn’t impress me.\n\nPrice: The prices felt a bit high for the portion sizes, especially given that the food didn’t hit the mark. I didn’t feel the meal was worth what I paid.\n\nDrinks: The drink menu had plenty of options, so there’s definitely something for everyone to pair with their meal.\n\nLocation & Accessibility: The restaurant is conveniently located with easy parking right outside, making it hassle-free to get to.\n\nOverall Experience:\nWhile the atmosphere and location are great, the food was a disappointment. I’ll give it another shot in the future, but this time I left feeling unsatisfied.",

The live music enhances the atmosphere, making it a delightful spot to unwind. The food is absolutely fantastic—especially the seafood soup, which is rich and flavorful. The calamari tempura is crispy and perfectly seasoned, a true treat. Don’t miss the Serradura for dessert, it's creamy and indulgent! Whether you're there for a casual meal or a special occasion, Fisherman's Wharf is the perfect blend of great food and vibrant atmosphere. Highly recommended!",
