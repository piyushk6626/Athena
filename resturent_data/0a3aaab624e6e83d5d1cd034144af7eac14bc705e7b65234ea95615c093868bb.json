We are from Karad and migrated to Australia 15 years ago, so eating local food is always a treat.After exploring beachside restaurants, we wanted to try some authentic goan local food.\nEnjoyed a variety of dishes at Matsya...crab chilli masala, tandoori baby corn/mushroom, chicken cafreal, chicken thecha kebab, prawn curry, and babycorn mushroom masala.\nSizzling chicken cafreal was very flavourful compared to the ones we tried previously.\nGreat ambience, amazing staff.\nUnique menu with a lot  of vegetarian options, too .It was great to meet the owners ,they made everyone feel special. It was very busy ,they  were personally attending everybody.\nWasheooms were very clean, which made our young girls very comfortable.\nPrices were also very reasonable.",

The Mackerel Fish Fry was fresh and spiced to perfection, while the Sharabi Chicken added a unique twist with its tangy, rum-infused flavor.\n\nFor the main course, the Prawns Thal and Kingfish Thal stole the show. Both came with a complete Goan thali experience, packed with vibrant flavors and fresh ingredients.\n\nTo top it all off, the Mojito and Kokum Sharbat were refreshing and complemented the meal beautifully. Matsya offers an unforgettable seafood dining experience with warm service and a cozy vibe. A must-visit when in Mapusa!",
