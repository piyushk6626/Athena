We had a lunch event for twenty three people and I must share that all of us described it as “a mind-blowing experience”.\nEverything was top notch. Fresh, original and creative food and beverage preparations. Excellent and truly gourmet. The ambience and views - stunning. The table setting - sophisticated and tasteful. The service- experienced and attentive. I could not have made a better selection and I cannot thank the team enough for making it so memorable and special for all of us.\nSlow Tide is a restaurant to be proud of. Kudos to the Owner, Chef, and the entire team.",

            "review_text": "My time at Slow Tide was quite good until it wasn't. The restaurant sits snugly overlooking the Anjuna Beach with plenty of open space, natural decor, and a lovely bar counter. The cocktails, the appetisers, and the atmosphere were all good and amazing. A few of the waitstaff were very friendly and polite.\n\nThe part I did not like:  That morning, I called them to make a dinner reservation to celebrate our anniversary. I was informed that it was first come, first serve (probably because we were a couple). That evening, we were seated below the deck but (when I spotted an empty table and asked for it) we were moved to the upper deck. The waitstaff did inform us that we MAY have to give up our table as it was reserved for a party of four. (I have to note here that there were plenty of empty tables with high chairs. I chose not to sit in one of those as they give me a back ache.) A couple of drinks and appetisers later, just when we were about to order the main course, we were asked to vacate the table. I felt it was rather impolite of them as we were still eating. Reluctantly, while vacating the table, I expressed my displeasure with one of the waitstaff. Surprisingly, he was quite condescending and rude. Obviously, we didn't want to resume our dinner and left the place dissatisfied.\nAll this displeasure could have been avoided had they simply reserved a table for us.",

If not, you can pay 200rs and park right outside. It’s a narrow road and I’m sure it gets busy.\n\nThe view is amazing. Slow tide is right at the beach. Reggae was playing and was quite pleasant. They seem to take reservations. They have a large space and an interior dining area too.\n\nWe ate -\n\n• Fish thali - brilliant, leaf wrapped small fish fillet, little crab, prawns, fish fritters, potato sabzi, small sol kadi, rice, halwa etc 5/5\n\n• Jaffna prawns - tiger prawns in a yummy masala with a string appam 5/5\n\n• veg multigrain sandwich with sweet potato chips - my vegetarian friend was elated 5/5\n\n• Bobby and the Bee cocktail - nice 4/5\n\n• acid Eric - 5/5\n\n• Chandra and Sandra - fine 4/5\n\n• jig fizz - 5/5\n\nWe paid through Zomato and got a slight discount. Super happy with our experience. We paid about 1200 pp.",
