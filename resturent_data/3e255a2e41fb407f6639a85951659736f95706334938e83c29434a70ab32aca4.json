May find some other better options at the same price.\n\nOn top of that you need to wait for 30 minutes to get a tablet.\n\nFood taste was really good.\n\nAt least you can try this once whenever you are in Calangute.\n\nHuge parking space.\n\nAmbience is also okay.",

Usually, this place gets crowded and recommended to arrive earlier.\n\nGreat food and beer choices, fish dishes highly recommend. It's definitely worth the visit and great value for money..\n\nWould love to be back again to try more other dishes.",

Also, they only offer mineral water which is twice as expensive as outside and when I asked for regular water the waiter staff said it was from the tap and made a face like as if it was radioactively contaminated or something.\n\nFood: Crab soup - lacked salt and was a simple crab broth with a few pieces of crab.\nPrawn Butter garlic- not great not too bad. Would probably skip this dish the next time.\nSeafood pizza - star of the show honestly. Was far better than the seafood pizza I’ve had at Artichoke’s New York too. The seafood pizza is a must try.",
