            "review_text": "Positive things first - the vibe of the place is just really soft and soothing, a perfect place for your family to hangout and have a couple of cocktails. We loved the vibe with really good crowd. It’s in the backwaters so you can experience a really warm breeze coming in instead of sea smell which could be irritating sometimes. The location was perfect in a way to have a good time with your family and friends. Even the food was not that bad. The staff were really nice and humble. Good experience overall.\nFeedback - the food is overpriced! We loved the cocktails but the quantity of the food looking at the prices was below average. It’s like 4 small shrimps @1800. It was incredibly small portion like tasting menu instead of food on a plate. I hope they improve it over time as they got a really good ambiance, smooth jazz music, an amazing vibe. Food is where they really need to focus on. I don’t remember the pricing of cocktails but I am pretty confident everything was overpriced from my experience. At the end of the it’s Goa - unnecessary overpriced.",

They have a great mix of dishes from around the world, with fresh seafood being a standout. Their cocktails are also really tasty. The staff is super friendly and always ready to help. Whether you're on a date, with family, or hanging out with friends, it's a fantastic place to enjoy a meal. Definitely check it out!",

The cocktails are  amazing and well made with plenty of in-house options to choose from. The food is their crow jewel, with an ample amount of options and decent portion sizes. We were very happy with the service and how warm the staff is, especially Arup, who hosted us and deserves a special mention in this review. If you're in Goa and want delicious food with an amazing ambience, it's a must to visit Kiki- By the sea.",
