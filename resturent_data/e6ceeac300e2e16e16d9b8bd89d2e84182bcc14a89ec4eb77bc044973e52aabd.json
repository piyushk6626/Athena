While the ambiance was decent, the service left much to be desired. The staff seemed inattentive and took a long time to take our order and serve the food.\nSpeaking of food, the flavors were not as authentic as I had hoped for a Goan restaurant. The dishes lacked the rich spices and freshness that one associates with Goan cuisine. The seafood, in particular, did not taste as fresh as it should have.\nThe portion sizes were small compared to the price, which made the meal feel overpriced for the quality offered. Overall, while the concept of the restaurant is promising, there is significant room for improvement in terms of service, food quality, and value for money.",
