            "review_text": "Shradha Classic is a good place for families to dine and have a pleasant time. The ambiance and setup are nice for a casual outing. However, our experience with the food was mixed.\n\nWe had originally visited the restaurant to try their thali, as recommended by reviews, but were disappointed to learn that it’s only available in the afternoon. As a result, we had to order other items from the menu.\n\nWe ordered Chicken Tawa Fry , expecting large, substantial pieces based on the image displayed. Unfortunately, what we received was very small, thin pieces that felt overpriced around ₹380. When we inquired, we were told the image was merely for marketing purposes, which was disappointing. Assuming a larger portion similar to tandoor-style chicken, we were let down by both the size and presentation of the dish.\n\nChicken Manchow Soup: It was decent in taste, but the chicken quantity in the soup felt insufficient.\n\nChicken Biryani: Was okay, but nothing extraordinary.\n\nSeradura dessert: It was a complete letdown—it was served frozen and lacked the quality I've experienced elsewhere. I wouldn’t recommend trying it here.\n\nOne suggestion for improvement: Please Ensure dishes are served fully and neatly, with no half-filled bowls or incomplete servings or little leftover. Presentation and portion size should align with the price and expectations.\n\nWhile the place has potential, the food quality and consistency need significant improvement. This review is based on my personal experience, and I hope it helps others make an informed decision.",

We also tried their Banjara Chicken Kebab, which was delicious with tender, fresh chicken, and the Mushroom Chilly Fry, which was equally tasty. I highly recommend checking this place out! Although we didn’t get a chance to try their seafood, which they’re known for, I suggest you don’t miss it!",
