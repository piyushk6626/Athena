Should try all beers like corona, hoegaarden, Heineken, Beera white. Ambience is very good. Music is at its peak. People coming to Goa and feel like trying new taste of beer and food, I suggest u should try this place.",

Food is delish to be fair and price is not too bad. Maybe a bit pricy compare to local bars but they have tons of monitors and music playing so its just fair.",

Looks like a British cafe . the ground level section has dance floor while upstairs was much interesting for me as it had pool table to play which I always think is great. The beer which you see in the picture is about 500ml for 400 rupees and you get the other free. Prior to that you have to make your card for rupees 1000 which you can further use.",
