On top of that, the service was abysmalâ€”staff were inattentive, rude, and seemed uninterested in serving customers. It took forever for our food to arrive, and when it did, it was cold and unappetizing. Overall, a complete waste of time and money. I wouldnâ€™t recommend this place to anyone.",

Amazing food.\nMust try their Fish Thali and some Chinese food items.\nSizzlers here are good but takes a lot of time to arrive.\nBiryani here is also decent and value for money.\nGood restaurant if you are a student or working person,as it is of reasonable price and fast service.\nAmbience is pretty good, lighting is also decently lit.",
