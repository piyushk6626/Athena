Ordered their roast chicken crossiant, turkish adana chicken kebab roll, caramel cappuccino and hazelnut cappuccino. The chicken crossiant came loadded with chicken along with tomato, olives, and lettuce and sauces. The kebab roll was mouthwatering, juicy loaded with pickled onions and spices. And the cappuccinos were a warm hug in the winters. Food was on point. Tried their chocolate and fruit tart as well which was so heavenly. Definitely worth another visit. Highly recommended",
