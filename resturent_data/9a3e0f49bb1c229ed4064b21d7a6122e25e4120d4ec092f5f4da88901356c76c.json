            "review_text": "Located in front of Santana Beach Resort in Candolim, Calamari offers a prime beachfront dining experience. The restaurant's convenient location makes it easily accessible for both locals and tourists staying in the area.\n\nCalamari in Goa is a fantastic place to enjoy a meal right by the beach. It's conveniently located with plenty of parking, and the restaurant itself is large and spacious, providing ample room for a comfortable dining experience. While there are a few shacks available, they tend to fill up quickly around sunset, so it's wise to arrive early if you want a prime spot.\n\nWe tried the Fish and Chips, and it was excellent. The fish was fresh, and the chips had the perfect amount of crispiness. The service was commendable, with friendly and attentive staff. However, the prices are a bit higher than what you might typically find in Goa these days, but the quality of the food and the overall experience make it worthwhile. In summary, Calamari is a great option for dining in Goa, especially if you're seeking a spacious and well-situated restaurant with delicious food.",

The area is wide enough to accommodate 100 people in one go.\nPeople can enter right from the candolim beach itself, it has a beach entrance,\nTaste is super delicious, but vegetarian dishes are limited.",

The food is always a hit here and then portions are good too. Service was fast and professional. It's a very beautiful shack that's very well managed.",
