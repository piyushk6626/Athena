During the evening time they play music as well which sets the ambience for the night as well. The food is amazing and would change anything about it. The management is very friendly. We were being attended by Prakash who’s very friendly and knowledgeable make sure you ask for him when you visit you won’t be disappointed by the service and the hospitality. Make sure to try the golden fried calamiri and masala fries here.",

Toilets are always spotlessly clean with separate ladies and Gents. It has proper enclosed showering facilities and separate changing room.\n\nThe Waiter's Tinker, Dave and Parakash are all very friendly and helpful and can't do enough for you. You'll be assured of a warm welcome and to be well looked after.\n\nThe food is cooked by chefs Ravi and Pulin and is some of the best shack food I've eaten here in Candolim all prepared fresh not frozen out of a packet.\nFavourites from the menu for us were  the home made spicy potato wedges and onion rings these are a must.\nSpicy Hakka Noodles and half a Tandoori Chicken super tasty\nFor those of you like more European fare there's a choice of Pizza's I can personally recommend the Farmhouse as the veggie option. and chicken Tikka Pizza for the meat eaters lovely thin crispy crust better than Papa John's\nAlso great toasted sandwiches and the classic fish fingers\nFull selection of hot and cold beverages I can recommend the banana lassi.\nDuring the day the shack is peaceful and relaxing, plenty of sunbeds  and shade,  as sunset approachs tables and chairs are put out on the beach and music goes on so you get the best of both worlds..\nWe've throughly enjoyed spending our days here. We will definitely return.\nGive it a go you won't be disappointed",
