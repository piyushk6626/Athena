The service was bit slow maybe because of the huge crowd but the food compensated for it.\n\nThe wait time was 30 mins or so but the English breakfast and healthy breakfast had so much food that 1 order is sufficient for 2 adults. It comes with juice and coffee, 1 smoothie bowl and a sandwich with omelette.\n\nThe place had some activities area as well. There are play areas for kids as well. Overall I would recommend this place.",

There are art works for sale, sometimes artists and flee setup, alongside really good food\n\nThe cafe hosts gigs almost daily, adding to its lively vibe, and even offers interior boxing classes, yoga classes occasionally which is a fun and unique touch. Overall, Artjuna is a fantastic spot for great food, good vibes, and a bit of art shopping!\n\nFood is brilliant, fresh, tasty and flavorful. The salad and sandwiches we had were excellent\n\nWhat makes it extra special is the vibe—laid-back, friendly, and buzzing with creative energy. The adjoining boutique and art space make it a perfect spot to shop for quirky finds or simply soak in the artsy atmosphere.",
