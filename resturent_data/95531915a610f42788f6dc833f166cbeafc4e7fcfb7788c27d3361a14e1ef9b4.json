Several options for starters, many vegetarian choices, and a decent sweet dishes menu.\n\nThe servers take time to explain the different dishes, and also share their own favourites. One must try their Jamun signature drink.\n\nAbsolutely a must visit place in Goa. Highly recommended!!",

The ambiance captured the vibrant and laid-back spirit of Goa, with warm lighting and rustic charm. We sampled every cocktail on the menu and also tried some of their local gin, and all of them were excellent!  The food was nothing short of spectacular â€“ each dish was bursting with authentic flavors. The meat dishes, especially the prawn balchÃ£o, was incredibly fresh and perfectly spiced. The staff were friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable, adding to the overall experience. Whether you're craving traditional Goan delicacies or looking to try something new, this restaurant is a must-visit. A true culinary gem! Highly recommend!",

I highly recommend, we were a party of 12 and you can imagine it is never easy to serve but they did an amazing job. Must try if you are in goa",
