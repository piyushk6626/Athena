Unfortunately they don’t serve their thalis on Sunday.\nWe stayed for lunch anyway.\n\nThe service was quite relaxed in the typical Goan style, but it was worth the wait with the amazing prawn curry and prawn rava fry which were just outstanding and our favourites!\n\nWe also had silver fish fry, chinak fry -‘d surmai fry, along with some fish caldin.\nThese were all good, but not the best we’ve ever eaten.\n\nWhat makes this place worth it is the prawn curry of course, but also the stunning views! It is in a gorgeous green location overlooking trees and was absolutely perfect in the monsoon!\n\nThey also have an AC section which would be great during the summers, but then you lose the views.\n\nIt’s a good option if you’re in mapusa and want a nice open space instead of being in a cramped restaurant.",

We came through swiggy dine out and it was mentioned with free drink but the restaurant disagreed and caused a problem. The worst part was the serradura desert i had. It was just full of cream and only pinch of biscuit powder. It was very upsetting. Please improve on these points. Would love to change my reviews about it in the near future. Thank you.",
