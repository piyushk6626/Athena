Checking their menu got excited to see Prawns caldine because we had a lovely creamy one in Candolim, got horribly disappointed with what they served. It was watery (with no flavour of coconut milk or grated coconut- only turmeric taste). Please don't order caldine here. Plus there were a lot of flies around which was a downer.\nOtherwise ambience is chill with good music and there are two very friendly dogs to pet.",
