Plus, their cocktail menu is impressive, with something for everyone.\nThe ‚ÄúJoseph bar‚Äù I loved my experience. The ambiance is good, the food and beverage options are unique and delicious, and the staff is professional and pays attention to their customers. What else could I ask for? 5/5.\nThe place will blow your mind away. From their song selection to their food options, everything is perfectly curated. If you're a food lover and confused about where to go, go here. This place impressed me from start to finish. Starting with attentive staff and fast service, we deliver hot food and cold beverages. I'm coming back here.\nInstead of the simple recommendations, the staff asked about my taste, and based on that, they gave me drink and food recommendations. I must say their recommendations were great. They know their customers very well. üëå\nü´∂üèªJoseph bar from Hyderabad ‚ù§Ô∏è",
