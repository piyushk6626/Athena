However I think maybe it's more like a coffee and cake place, as we were told food could take up to an hour though they only have limited seating so not a very large number of customers around. However they did turn around an omelette fairly quickly in the end.",

We walked to the cafe, so had to climb a lot of stairs ( followed Google maps), but it was well worth it. The whole area was so quiet and the cafe was serene.\nYou can order online or at the counter and food is delivered to your table. Highly recommend the Eggs Benedict, Berry cooler and the coffee.\nThe art gallery is also an experience in itself and not to be missed.\nWould recommend for a great place to talk, be relaxed and have good food.",

Have one of the best coffees in town and not to miss the lovely art installations around it.",
