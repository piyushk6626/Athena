Last time I visited, non veg section was closed. I had tried their veg thali which was good. All the items in the plate tasted really well including the chutney which added a unique flavour. Rajma prepared did not played well with my taste palette. Quantity of the items are fulfilling. They serve you two rotis and rice which will make you full for sure.\nOverall a good thali.",

The stars of a thali are the rice, curry and fish and I was not happy with either of them. I am guessing they add soda to the rice which kinda bloats you up after the meal.\n\nNext time, I tried their chicken fried rice and chilli chicken. 250 for chilli chicken and 180 rupees for fried rice would be great to pay if it was extraordinarily good. But the taste here was as good as a local Street side Chinese shop.\n\nSo nope from my side.",
