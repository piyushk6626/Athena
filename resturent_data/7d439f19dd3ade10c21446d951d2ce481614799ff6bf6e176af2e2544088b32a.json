This restaurant  is close to Leela Homes, a homestay, so the people here are mostly tourists who saunter in for a decent meal. The food is good, freshly prepared, especially the South Indian varieties. They serve lunch and dinner items as well with a varied  menu comprising  Mughlai, Chinese, South Indian  and good breakfast options.\nService- Good\nAmbience- Okayish\nPrices- Very Affordable.",
