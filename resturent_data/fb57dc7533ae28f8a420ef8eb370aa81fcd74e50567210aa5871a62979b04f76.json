The restaurant has a soothing vibe, with gentle music that greets you as soon as you step in, instantly setting the mood for a relaxing evening. The place was filled with a mix of locals and tourists, which was a pleasant surpriseâ€”itâ€™s clear Ocean Grill has a well-deserved reputation that extends beyond just the locals. The indoor-outdoor setup enhances the ambiance, with each table seeming to have its own unique atmosphere.\n\nNow, on to the foodâ€”absolutely delicious! We ordered chicken fried rice, chicken Manchurian dry, butter chicken, butter naan, and a refreshing pina colada. Every dish was packed with flavor; the chicken Manchurian was perfectly crispy with a savory kick, and the butter chicken was creamy and rich, paired wonderfully with the soft, fluffy butter naan. The pina colada was the perfect companion, its refreshing taste balancing out the flavors of the food.\n\nOcean Grillâ€™s staff were exceptionally friendly, embodying the warm Goan hospitality that made us feel right at home. While thereâ€™s a bit of a wait for food, the ambiance and drinks make it easy to relax and savor the moment. For anyone who loves Chinese cuisine with a Goan twist, this place is an absolute must-visit. Itâ€™s the kind of spot youâ€™ll want to return to again and again.",
