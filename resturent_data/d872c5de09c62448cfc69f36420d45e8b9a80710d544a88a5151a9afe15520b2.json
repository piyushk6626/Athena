The ambiance is simple and clean, the staff is friendly and warm and the food is exceptional.\n\nTried their prawn thali and chonak rawa fry. Loved the marination on the fish and definitely tasted very fresh! Prawns were also nice and juicy and cooked perfectly. The other accompaniments in the thali were also so delicious.\n\nMostly order their tandoor items for takeaway. They‚Äôre excellent but will post another review on it later. üëãüèΩ",
