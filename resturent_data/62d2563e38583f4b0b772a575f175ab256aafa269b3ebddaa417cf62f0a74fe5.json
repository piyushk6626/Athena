While it‚Äôs not about the money, it‚Äôs about the waste of food and beverages. For example, a 6-year-old child cannot consume that much food or drink. I believe this should be avoided, as it leads to unnecessary waste. I would appreciate it if the team could ensure that the right portion sizes are given based on customer needs, rather than targeting specific upsells that may not suit everyone. Thank you.",

And she didn't gave me a bill at the moment of my payment. When I asked to print it 3 guys from the team were trying to avoid giving it to me.\nThey told- take a picture of the screen. I insisted on getting a bill, checked it, and understood why they behave so strange.",
