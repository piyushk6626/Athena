The staff is welcoming and warm.\n\nMust try the Sticky date pudding. I can eat this all day every day. Ugh. So good.\n\nGodzilla Roll - gives you that nice sushi look while being a roll. Tastes amazing with nice crunch. I ate 6 of those.\n\nTofu steak, sliced mushrooms, pok choy in chilli black bean sauce is good option for vegetarians. The tofu is so soft and instantly melts in your mouth.\n\nEnjoyed the food a lot and the recommendations were perfect from the staff. A must visit in Goa.",

Taste was very good.\n\nWe were helped by Ravi who was very quick in the service. Overall, a good place to try out if you want some spicy asian food.",

The duck was delicious and enough for 2 people. The best was the baked crab which was 2 in number. The cocktails were equally good. Their service is quick. They gave a complimentary pineapple kimchi. The dishes are pricey.",
