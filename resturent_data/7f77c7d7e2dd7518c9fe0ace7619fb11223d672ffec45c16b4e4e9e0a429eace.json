The ambience was absolutely stunning, and it set the perfect tone for an enjoyable meal.\nThe food was as delightful as the atmosphereâ€”every dish we tried was perfectly prepared and bursting with flavor.\nThe service was top-notch, with Mahesh taking great care of us. He was attentive, polite, and made our visit even more memorable.\nI would highly recommend anyone looking for a fantastic dining experience.",

We had serradura which was also tasty. The cost was economical and value for money.  All the staff were good and the service was quick. The ambience was good and it was not crowded. There was live music. Hindi songs were not the singers forte, could have sang in the language they are comfortable in.",
