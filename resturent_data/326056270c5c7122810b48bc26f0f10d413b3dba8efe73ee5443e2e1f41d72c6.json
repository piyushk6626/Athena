The service was remarkably efficient, and the staff were warm and attentive throughout the meal. With ample seating available, finding a table was effortless. The prices were reasonable, offering excellent value for the superb quality of both the cuisine and service. I highly recommend this gem for anyone seeking an exceptional dining experience by the beach!",

You do get to sit and stare at the ocean and if you want you can have your meal in the air conditioned place. Service is quick. It’s a large place with ample parking. Try to get a seat near the sea side. In the evening they put tables on the beach like others around.",

Had some fries to go with the beer. Exhaustive menu with options for all. We ordered for pork sausages chilly fry and beef chilly. The pork was nicely cooked and delicious, but the beef seemed chewy, not particularly to our liking. Ordered for red snapper and that too was disappointing. It seems somewhat overrated. But definitely not bad if one wants to just stop by for a few beers and light munch.",
