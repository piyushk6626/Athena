The food, the beef steak in mushroom sauce was juicy and tender, with the accompanying sauted veggies and mashed potatoes perfectly complimenting each other. The dog mash, was a bit sweeter than my preference but thats acceptable since its hot dogs amd mashed potatoes in bbq sauce. The chorizo chilli with poi was just brilliant. The drinks, of which i sampled were based on rum, were also mixed well, and they were very cheap too. Overall we had a great time with great food and great drinks. Special mention to the happy boy server who was very cordial and welcoming. Cheers team üëçüèΩ",

I ordered from Cherry Tomato on 3 occasions... everytime with a different experience.\n\nBurgers are usually in the 400 range but quite large. The mighty Joe burger had an overpowering taste of sweet onion sauce which ruined the palate, the New Yorker and German schnitzel burgers are good, the juicy Lucy burger is average and stay away from the crab burger...I had to bin it üò≠.\n\nThe onion rings are super crispy and delicious. The chicken creamy pasta is wonderful too.\n\nThe carribbean chicken and crispy chicken were like desserts... atleast way toooooo sweet for my taste buds.\n\n5/5 for portion size and 3/5 for taste.",

Also, they did well with Alfredo Chicken Pasta. It's a cosy hangout spot for you and your homies. Give them a shot, definitely!!! ;)",
