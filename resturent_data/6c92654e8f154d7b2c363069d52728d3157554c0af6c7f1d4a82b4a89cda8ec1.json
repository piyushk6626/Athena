            "review_text": "I recently ordered the Chicken Pepperoni Stuffed Garlic Bread from the Domino's app. The delivery was impressively quick, arriving within 20 minutes. However, the Chicken Pepperoni Stuffed Garlic Bread was very disappointing. It was dry inside, containing only pepperoni and a little cheese. The usual gooey, melted cheese that I look forward to was missing, making it very dry to eat.\n\nThis raises the question: Is Domino's prioritizing delivery within 30 minutes over the quality of their product? This is the second time I've been disappointed by Domino's in recent times. The product's appearance on the box sets high expectations, but the reality is quite different.",

Tables are dirty, flies everywere , lacks hygiene.\n\nThe cook which made my pizza , also was clearing tables üòúü§û.\n\nWhen I showed the pic of their washroom to the order taker , she told me to show to him and he gave me excuse there is no water . Look at the pics , this is not days but months no one has cleaned the toilet .\n\nAnd the sitting area is full of flies , may be its a cherry üçí on top . It's sign that the sitting area is also not properly sanitised .\n\nI think the staff was also short of cheese also , because was so less on the pizza , üçï,chicken pieces seems like topping put on top of pizza , very less too.\n\nFirst time I have not recieved my token no on message , nor I have a bill on mssg .",
