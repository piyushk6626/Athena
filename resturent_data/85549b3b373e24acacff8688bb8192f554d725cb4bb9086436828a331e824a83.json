Most of the food was excellent, especially the King Prawns, Fish Grill with Chips, and Fish Curry Rice, which were flavorful and perfectly cooked. However, the Fish Fingers fell short of expectations and didn’t match the quality of the other dishes.\n\nThe service was good, and the overall experience was satisfying. I’d highly recommend this place for seafood lovers and anyone looking to enjoy a meal with a great atmosphere.",

The first time I visited Brittos was in 2007 along with my childhood friends and the feeling was just heartfelt and raw. The candlelight dinner and drinks by the beach is something I will always remember. The restaurant has grown over the period and is now very elaborate with a lot of indoor and outdoor seating along with Karaoke in the evenings. The food is something which is delicious. I would specifically recommend the tiger prawns and crabs. A perfect all in one place to go with family or friends. Highly recommended",

Service is reasonably quick and overall food quality is great. It is an upscale place and hence pricing is a little on the higher side. Interiors are quite nicely done and it has clean washrooms inside. This place is best enjoyed in groups.",
