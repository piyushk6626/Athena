Especially pancakes and cream. It's my personal favourite. I highly recommend it.\n\nAlthough the food arrived late. The service is good.",

Vietnamese coffee was great but consistency was missing because we ordered it again and it wasn’t as great as the first one. Tropical pancake was good. Flat white was very okay in taste while carrot cake was horribly sweet.\n\nAbout the ambience, they need to expand the place because it feels pretty crowded even with less people.\n\nOverall, I personally felt the hype over this place is not justified. Considering food and coffee prices in other cafes/restaurants in Palolem area, both prices are higher at Mills but the taste is barely worth the price.\n\nPS: Brownie points for the cute doggo in the cafe !\n\nEdit 1: Forgot to mention that one of our orders was missed.\n\nEdit 2: You can’t justify everything with so called “New Zealand food style”. We had Vietnamese coffee twice from your place and both tasted was different.",

Coffee is excellent and good WiFi, so many people use it to get some work done.\n\nWe tried all kind of foods, but our favourite was benny eggs and homemade kombucha. Most people are hyped about their smoothie bowls, which are HUGE. These are good, but unfortunately not cold (more like room temperature) - please maks them coler, it’s a game changer. Our favourite was charcoal smoothie bowl.\n\nI didn’t like the pancakes with cream. Somehow bitter and the vegan cream wasn’t very tasty. Looked better than tasted.",
