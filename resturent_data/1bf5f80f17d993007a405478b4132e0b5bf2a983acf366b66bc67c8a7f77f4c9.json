For our dinner we ordered chicken hot garlic, chicken biryani and  chicken fried rice. Portion is good. One biryani is sufficient for one person. Taste is good. We ordered chicken hot garlic dry but it comes wet with gravy/salad only. Taste is good. Next day we visited for breakfast and ordered masala dosa, set dosa and kesari bath. Dosa is fried properly. Samabar taste is good. Chutney taste can be improved. Chutney was prepared with coconut which taste okay. This can be improved. Overall taste and price are good and affordable. I will suggest to visit this place.",

Even had Chapati and Gravy.. quantity of gravy was huge (sufficient for 4)\n\nOverall, a must visit restaurant- especially if you are near Palolem..\nExpect only good food and service .. No frills like fancy vibe, etc..\nGood part is it is very economical..!\n\nMust try King fish masala fry, Idli, Dosa..",
