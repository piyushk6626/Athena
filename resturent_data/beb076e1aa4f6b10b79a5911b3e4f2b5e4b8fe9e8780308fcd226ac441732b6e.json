I tried the beef, crab, chicken, and bun, and everything was exceptionally tasty. The flavors are authentic, and the service is warm. A must-visit for food lovers!",

(no other Dessert on the menu!)\nExcept for the fish (Bombil),  the food was enjoyable.\nService good.\nAmbiance somewhat noisy, as faces the busy road traffic.\nThey serve alcohol - no alcohol menu though,  for reasons best known to them.\nWould recommend this place for a decent Goan meal, mainly for the meats.",

After a forgettable meal, nature called, and I politely asked to use the restroom. To my shock and disbelief, the staff refused. Yes, you read that correctly—denied access to a basic facility that any paying customer should be entitled to.\n\nThe excuse? “Only paying customers can use the restroom.” I had already ordered food and drinks, mind you, and was in the middle of eating. Not only was this policy incredibly bizarre, but it also felt downright disrespectful. There is absolutely no reason a customer should be treated like this, and it’s completely against the spirit of hospitality.\n\nThe staff was unhelpful and cold when I asked for clarification, and it left a really bad taste in my mouth—literally and figuratively. I will NEVER return to a place that doesn’t have the decency to provide basic customer service or common human decency. If you’re looking for a place that values basic courtesy and respect, look elsewhere.",
