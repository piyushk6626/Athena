Happened to find this place on Google and decided to visit it with friends. The food here is awesome, prepared fresh by the owner and chef Vishal who checks on his guests personally for preferences and taste. He will not hesitate to cook up something not on the menu too. We tried the Pomfret, Surmai and Veg thalis which were delicious. The thalis are available only from 12.30 to 3.30pm. The butter garlic prawns were also very good. Also had rava fried chonak and was hooked to the delicate fried coating and freshness of the fish. We ended up eating 3 times in the 2 days we were there. You definitely should eat here, you will not be disappointed. Thanks to Vishal for being a great host, you can taste the passion for cooking in his food. Good luck to you Vishal,  just dont convert this great place to a karaoke bar!!",

Also the kingfish fry and prawn fry in rava. Must try item.But Food is not spicy, you will be disappointed if you love spicy food. It's really amazing to see the owner 'Vishal' was handing over the food for each and every customer personally and was talking with them atleast for 5 min. That really feels like we are a guest at his home. Do try when you are in Goa.",
