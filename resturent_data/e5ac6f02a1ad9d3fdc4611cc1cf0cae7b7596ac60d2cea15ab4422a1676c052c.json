The first thing it's somewhat above average in case of price but the reality is they provide in that much quantity.... It's worthy in that price.... We had biriyani and we ordered only one seeing the quantity..... A single biriyani is good enough for two.....",

However, we liked the Chilly babycorn (3.5/5) & Veg. Biriyani (3/5).\n\nThey have both outdoor and indoor sitting area. Service is somewhat okay. If you are not a local, please know that You need to give clear instructions to the waiters while ordering food.",
