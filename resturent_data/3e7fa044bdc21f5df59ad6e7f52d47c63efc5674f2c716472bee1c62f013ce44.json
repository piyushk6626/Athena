            "review_text": "In a quest to search for the best Goan fish thali, we landed here on a weekend during lunch hours and oh boy, it was a painful wait of an hour in the scorching heat. Even after we had booked a table for 8 the previous night through Easy Diner platform, the restaurant denied and did not honour our booking because of an issue between them and the Easy Diner platform. We were seated on the top deck after an hour and we ordered a few Fish Thalis, King Fish masala fry, egg fried rice, chicken lollipops, Goan veg platter and veg biryani and a few drinks to go with it. As soon as the thali arrived, we started belting and collectively decided that this was the best Goan Fish thali out of all the thalis we had during our 6-day trip to Goa. The prawns curry, the boneless fish fry, the sides to go with it were all very tasty and fulfilling. Even the barfi on the plate was too good. Chicken lollipops and egg fried rice were great too. King Fish masala fry was a bit sour to our taste and was not liked by everyone. The server did give us a heads up about it before we ordered it, so it's all good. The only disappointment was the Goan veg platter. Paying a premium for such less veg sides was not a good plan and the items did not taste very well either. Overall, it was a great experience devouring Goan fish thali and other seafood and chicken items here. A worthy visit and I highly recommend this place for other tourists/travellers. The restrooms were neat and clean and the sinks were kept well and tidy too. The restaurant has won a lot of awards and accolades and the same has been stuck on the wall and one can witness it while going to the top deck. The only nitpicking here i would do is the cramped space and how tiny the restaurant and the waiting area is. It is a very cramped space and a 6 feet human has to bend and watch their head on the top deck while walking around. Even the crowd gets too busy and takes away the ambience of having good food. The waiting area is overfilled during peak lunch hours and one has to stay back in the heat while their family and/or friends wait in the car with the comfort of air conditioning until they get a table confirmation.",

We found no tissues on the table,no water was offered,no finger bowls & a general apathy towards customers. The food at best was decent. Nothing to match the hype. Plenty of brilliant restaurants in Goa. Makes no sense visiting this restaurant. Not recommended.",
