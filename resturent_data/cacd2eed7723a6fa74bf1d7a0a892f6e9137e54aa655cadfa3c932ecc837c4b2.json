The burgers, while good, could use a bit of improvement in terms of flavor and juiciness. However, the Platter is definitely worth trying; it’s well-crafted and offers a variety of delicious options. Additionally, it’s worth noting that you can bring your own booze which adds a nice touch to your dining experience.",
