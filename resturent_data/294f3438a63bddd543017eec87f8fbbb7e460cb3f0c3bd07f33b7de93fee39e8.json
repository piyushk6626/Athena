It's really close to the Candolim beach and has a large selection of dishes available with north indian, seafood, goan, and even a few continental dishes. They've got a happy hour offer for beer as well. There's live sports screening available and live music also at night.\n\nWe tried a chicken curry and a prawns starter, both of which were good. The staff was helpful and welcoming. The only thing I sort of did not like was the color decor that actually highlighted the restaurants theme but then it deviated from the goan vibe in terms of the ambience.",

Lovely live music adds up and makes the place even more memorable.\nSpecially Mr. Vishwanath is very courageous and attentive. He has gone above and beyond to ensure a memorable dining experience..!\nHighly recommend this place..!",
