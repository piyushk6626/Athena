I tried their Chicken Lollipop, Golden Fried Squids, Chicken Cafreal, and Kingfish Thali—each dish was packed with authentic Goan flavors and cooked to perfection. The Falooda and Chikoo Shake were the perfect refreshing finish to the meal.\n\nThis cafe is not just about food, it’s an experience! Whether you’re a local or visiting, Xavier Cafe is a must-visit for anyone craving soulful, delicious food. Highly recommended!",

We did appreciate the friendliness of the uncle who took our order, but the food itself was pretty average. Also, parking is a hassle if you're coming by car. I really wanted to love this place since I'm a big fan of old cafes, but it seems like it may have lost its charm.",

Xavier  , a local gem since 1933 known for their Egg Chops and Falooda.\n\nThe charm of this café lies not only in its nostalgic appeal but also in its enduring staff, who have been serving generations of locals and visitors alike.\n\nThe menu features authentic Goan dishes like Chicken Cafreal and Squids Recheado, alongside an array of snacks, fresh juices, shakes, and desserts.\n\nWith its air-conditioned section and consistently warm service from familiar faces, Café S. F. Xavier is a must-visit for both locals and visitors seeking a heartwarming culinary journey through Goan flavours!\n\nA quick heads-up: They also serve beef and pork, which might be a consideration for some. I personally love their rissois, egg chops, and falooda (which still doesn’t include seviyan).\n\nThe place can get pretty packed, so visit a bit early—they open at 8:30 am. During peak hours, the service can be a little slow. :)",
