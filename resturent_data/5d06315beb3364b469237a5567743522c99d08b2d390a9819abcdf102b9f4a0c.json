Then I called the manager to which he did not even apologize & told me we will prepare another one and serve.\n\nIf a customer finds a chicken piece in a veg dish then this clearly states that they don't prepare veg dishes separately.\n\nI did not pay the bill and clearly told the manager that I am going to post this review.\n\nTo all those people who are strictly vegan thinking to visit this restaurant, DO NOT VISIT THIS RESTAURANT EVER.\n\nPHOTO ATTACHED FOR REFERENCE.",
