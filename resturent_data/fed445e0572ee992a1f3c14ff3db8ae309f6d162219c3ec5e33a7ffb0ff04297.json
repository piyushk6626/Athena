It is a private place so that would be entry only if you have a specific package tour, or if you Are from their community All in All, itâ€™s an amazing place to chill and go with your friends. There are specific places on the table booked only for particular community, which made me feel that it was a biased restaurant high possibility that it was just for that particular day.",

Orange and Pomegranate juice had no pomegranate and was served in beer glass ðŸ˜” We ordered Garden Quinoa salad- was completely blank no salt no lemon no dressing and tiger prawns salad had small prawns.\n\nSo the food experience wasn't great- you can try anything else. The seating is very comfy.",

Everything was delicious. Desserts could have been a step better.\n\nNow, why the 3.7 stars you might wonder, yes, the place attracts a lot of Russian crowd, who really do their own thing.\nWhat disheartened us was we went on a late evening, place was almost empty, there are no 2 seater tables the staff requested us to take a 4/6 seater, however a russian guest/personnel known to the restaurant had an objection to it and came and told the staff why pass it only to a couple.\n\nStaff, to my genuine amusement, kept their word declined the over intrusive and \"karen\" lady and passed the table.\n\nWonderful evening/night if not for that lady.\n\nLastly, please try and get smaller tables for 2/4 seater 99% tables are for groups of 6 and above.",
