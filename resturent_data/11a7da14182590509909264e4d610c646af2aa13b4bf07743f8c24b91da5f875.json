My favourites here are butter chicken and garlic naan, mutton biryani.\nThe staff is super hospitable. Love the uncle at entrance in his grand attire and lovely moustache always welcoming us with a wide smile. Warm ambience with low retro instrumental music and match being displayed on game days. When in Goa, don‚Äôt miss Delhi Darbar :)",

Fresh lime water on medium as we asked. Best part was black pepper chicken üçó ü§§ mouth watering properly cooked soft and tinder and to get a crisp of it mixed with nice salad best starter i had.\nWould rate this place 4.6 out of 5 üëå Highly recommended i would have tried darbar chicken special but tummy was full maybe next time.",
