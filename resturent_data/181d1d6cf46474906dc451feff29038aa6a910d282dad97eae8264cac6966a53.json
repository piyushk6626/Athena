We ordered the Goan breakfast and a vegan breakfast- both were delicious!\n\nOnly con is the noise from the cars when sat outside in the courtyard but not much can be done by Caravela to change that.\n\nOverall, would definitely recommend!",

Cappuccino was next, no words, they were just too good. I had my American Breakfast and everything was fresh, later I got a Chocolate Cupcake, it was delicious. Even they gave a spoon along side it. Later we ordered a Bombay Sandwich. Very filling, it had tomatoes, capsicum, potatoes, cucumbers, cheese, and some onions. It was so good.\nOn the side was potato wedges. Perfectly crunchy and sumptuous. 10/10\n\n**Service:**\nVery fast.\n\n**Estimated Times:**\nAmerican Breakfast with Watermelon Juice - 10-15 minutes\nEnglish Breakfast with Watermelon Juice - 10-15 minutes\nCappuccino - 5-10 minutes\nChocolate Cupcake - 1-5 minutes\nBombay Sandwich with Potato Wedges - 10-18 minutes.\nStrawberry Shake - 10-16 minutes\n\n**Atmosphere:**\n\nVery cold, ACs everywhere, not to mention fans too! If you don’t like cold and like fans, the outside seating is for you.\n\nRating: 5 stars.",
