Wanted to have a couple of cocktails, they had one interesting Christmas menu, and I tried their Jingle Bell Smash, was nice. The other one I asked for was the Raspberry LIIT, it was good too. I still know for sure many of the LIITs prepared in Goa still donâ€™t use all 5 spirits, something did miss here, yet it felt good though. Want to try more of their cocktails and food, hopefully next time.",
