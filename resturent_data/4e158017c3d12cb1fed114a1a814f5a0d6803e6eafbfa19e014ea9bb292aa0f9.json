We had ordered their Chonak fish thali in which we got a big piece of Chonak fish along with various side dishes included in the thali. Along with it we had ordered their Fish fingers which also tasted very good. All the items were equally delicious. Their sitting place and ambience add to the vibe. The owner and staff were very humble and gave us quick service.\nIts a must visit restaurant in Panjim.",
