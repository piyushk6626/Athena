We visited this place on 1 June 2024 for lunch. We tried the Goan chonak and modso thali with vellyo rawa fry. The thali consisted of rice, prawn curry, bhindi bhaji, one piece of fish, kismoor, shevyo, sol kadi, salad, pickle and papad. I was disappointed with the salad served in the thali as it was all cut cabbage and one piece of carrot. However, the fried fish in the thali was fresh. The sweet in the thali was tasteless. The vellyo fry  was not that fresh but had a little better salad with some tomato and onion pieces. I found the thali a little expensive for the quality and quantity. The service was so slow that we had to wait for an hour till the food arrived. The staff is not welcoming at all.\n\nâ€¢ Trip type: Family\nService: 1.0\nâ€¢ Location: 2.5\nâ€¢ Hotel highlights: Place with many tables, quite and breezy.\nâ€¢ Walkability: 1minute walk from main road.\nâ€¢ Food & drinks:  Fine",

It tends to make you feel like having your meal with greenery all around you and also enjoy it while sharing your thoughts and love.\nIt has ample parking space as well for all vehicles.\nThe place is big enough to enjoy the natural view as they have an amazing ground beside the restaurant that makes it a little eye-catching to watch.\nThe restaurant has an outdoor seating area that is quiet and warm as well.\nWe tried out king fish (king mackerel). In spite of the fish being masala fried, you could specifically taste the fish.\nNow you would be surprised to know why I said so. I have tried out many fish dishes where they just have a taste of masala, but this fish had a perfect blend of Indian spices on the fish and tasted yummy. The squid was delicious.\nAnother surprise was that we got 4 slices of beautiful fish and it just cost us Rs.400, whereas it would cost you around Rs.1000+ in Mumbai.\nThe taste of the food is really awesome, and you should definitely try out their seafood menu.\nThe service staff were really nice and interactive. I enjoyed spending time at this restaurant.\n\nOverall rating :- 3.2ðŸŒŸ\nâ€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”-\nAmbience         -  3ðŸŒŸ\nHygiene             -  2ðŸŒŸ\nFood                  -  4ðŸŒŸ\nStaff                   -  3ðŸŒŸ\nInteraction        -  4ðŸŒŸ",
