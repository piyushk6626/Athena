            "review_text": "Had a great dining experience at Antonio. The Crab Poppers were perfectly crispy with a deliciously seasoned filling, making them a great start to the meal. The Chicken 31 was cooked to perfection, tender and flavorful, showcasing a unique blend of spices. The highlight for me was the Prawn Bhel, which brought together crunchy textures and tangy flavors, elevated by the fresh prawnsâ€”a creative and delightful twist on a classic.\n\nThe cocktails were equally impressive. The Watermelon Fizz was refreshing, light, and fruity, while the Smoked Pineapple Margarita stood out with its smoky-sweet flavor profile, offering a perfect balance that complemented the meal.\n\nOverall, the food and drinks were delicious, portions were satisfying, and the pricing felt reasonable for the quality offered.",

Cocktails were good, but felt like the quantity of the dishes were very less compared to the price.\nThe atmosphere is amazing though.\nWould recommend to visit and have a good time with friends, the music is great!",

If you want a smoking table, thats available as well by the windows.\nThere were variety of foods and drinks, affordable and tasty. Clean washrooms and helpful staffs- every aspect it deserves a 5 star.\nHowever compared to the crowd, the no of waiters seemed to be falling short, something to improve upon.",
