The overall experience was below average as the hospitality was not up to the mark. While some dishes were decent, the food quality overall left room for improvement.",

From the moment we stepped in, it was a delightful experience, thanks to the warm hospitality of Host Rahul Dalvi, who made us feel right at home.\n\nThe seafood is nothing short of awesome – fresh, flavorful, and perfectly cooked! The portions were generous, and the pricing was unbelievably reasonable for the quality and quantity we received.\n\nThe interiors are simply outstanding – a visual treat! It’s rare to find such a beautifully designed space along the highway. With a seating capacity of over 350 people, it’s perfect for large gatherings, yet cozy enough for a family meal.\n\nParking is often a challenge on long road trips, but not here – there’s ample parking space to accommodate vehicles of all sizes.\n\nIf you’re a seafood lover and appreciate great ambiance, Ankita Classic is a must-visit. It’s more than just a restaurant; it’s an experience you’ll cherish! Don’t miss this gem if you’re traveling in the area.",

            "review_text": "I visited this place twice and it was fantastic. Large parking space, good ambience, staffs behaviour was good all are cooperative. I tasted 10 different types of fishes here and all were good in taste. Actually I ordered starters those were good in taste and later ordered thali. Thali was good but not able to finish full thali because it was too big. So I would suggest if you order starters then surely go for small thali and share big thali because lots of food will waste later. So, I would suggest you should visit this place once if you are seafood lover and it is affordable not too costly.",
