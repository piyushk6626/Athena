The food here was excellent, and what truly stood out was their super fast service—perfect for those who want a quick yet satisfying meal at a very reasonable price\n\nAnother great feature is the spacious parking area, which is a big plus considering how crowded the area can get. Whether you’re in a hurry or just want to enjoy a relaxed veg meal, Dwarka is a great choice!",

They give three spoonful of Kadai paneer for 300/-\nDo not ever visit this restaurant. It'll spoil your trip.",
