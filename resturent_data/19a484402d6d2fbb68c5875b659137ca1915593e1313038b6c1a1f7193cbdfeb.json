We were served extremely cold soup and when we pointed it out, he made a dirty face and said \"it is so hot\". Also after taking our order of breads after 30 minutes he returns saying we don't have that particular bread.\n\nThe food is also average at best. The xacuti didn't feel unique at all and lacked flavour overall.\n\nAvoid.",
