Despite the wait, it was worth it. The dishes were incredibly tasty, although the portions were on the smaller side â€“ but the quality made up for it. The restaurant itself is a nice and cozy AC spot, perfect for escaping the heat.\n\nOne downside is the lack of dedicated parking, but you can manage to find a spot near Temptation. The staff was really nice and friendly, and considering the weekend rush, they kept their calm and provided great service. Overall, it was a satisfying experience!",
