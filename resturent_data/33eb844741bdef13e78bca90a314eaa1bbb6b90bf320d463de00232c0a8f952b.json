Dining here means enjoying your meal while listening to the soothing sounds of the wavesâ€”a truly serene experience. The starters and mocktails are delicious, and the overall vibe is incredibly relaxing. As a beach lover, I highly recommend it. The only thing that could have made my experience even better would have been some music playing in the background.",
