We have ordered multiple dishes from their menu including veg and Non veg dishes.\nTo be frank the quantity which they serve for each dish was very less. But the quality of taste they provide was really great. The price was also bit high.\nIf you guys need tasty food which has less quantity then you can visit this place with great ambience in South Goa.\n\nDo visit this place with your friends and family for good quality food in South Goa.",

The mocktails are equally impressive, with unique, refreshing blends that complement the meal beautifully. The Serradura, a delightful dessert, is the perfect sweet ending, with its creamy, indulgent layers leaving a lasting impression. The ambiance is warm and inviting, and the staff are attentive and friendly, making the experience even more enjoyable. A perfect spot for a memorable meal!",
