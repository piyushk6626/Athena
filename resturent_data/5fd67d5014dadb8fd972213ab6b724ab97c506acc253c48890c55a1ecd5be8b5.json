They bring the bill immediately after you finish your food, making it feel like youâ€™re being rushed to leave. Restaurants should create a relaxed atmosphere where customers can enjoy their time with friends without feeling hurried",

In main course we tried chicken ghee roast, chicken kadai, cheese garlic naan, biriyani and some other dishes.. Food taste was good and portion size was okay.. Should try Chicken ghee roast...\nLocated just before colva beach parking area... Parking space available for 2W only... 4W can be parked in beach parking area...\nOverall a great experience...",
