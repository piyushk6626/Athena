Even though there was only one other couple in the restaurant and five staff members present, the service was extremely slow. I had to get up and ask for the bill myself because no one came for so long that my taxi ended up waiting for me. This kind of inattentiveness is unacceptable and overshadowed the overall experience.",

And When i Tried to Discuss this issue with the Heart Beat Restaurant In Mapusa North Goa . They say we don't put veggies In Our Mix Fried Rice. The worst Restaurant You Can't Rely On. Think 1000 Times Before Ordering From Then so That Your Hard Earned Money won't Go waste because of such restaurant. And When i Asked About the veggies in the mix fried Rice, he says you should mention adding veggies in Mix Fried Rice, such a very bad treatment from the restaurant itself to the customer",

Great ambience. The fish tank at the entrance looks cool. I stopped coming here 2 years back because I the food used to be average and sometimes inconsistent. Some dishes were below average. Returned here after 2 years. Came here as didn't have any option. I was skeptical at first, the food was nice. The quality of food had improved a lot compared to what I had before.",
