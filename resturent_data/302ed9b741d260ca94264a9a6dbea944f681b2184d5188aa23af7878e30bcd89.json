            "review_text": "The restaurant is located in a quiet area and there is no dedicated parking, but one can park on the road. It is very popular with the locals. The place is very basic and one should avoid the closed portion as it is very noisy. The food is another story. We had chonak fry, liver masala, fried prawns, chicken masala, prawn pulao and nans. All well dishes were superb and the portions were good. Pricing is quite reasonable and the service was very quick. The bar service is just about ok and they had limited quantity of feni- this is an absolute no-no for a Goan restaurant. Do not go for the decor or atmosphere- the food makes up for the lack thereof. Definitely a place to try out some genuine seafood. The place is closed on Thursdays. For wheelchair guests, there are two steps for which the staff can assist.",
