Ordered the chicken lollipop which we felt like the coating was a bit too much and it was undercooked.\nBut our main-course was amazing and very tasty.\nWould give 5 stars easily for the service they provide , the quality of the main course , price and the ambience.\nWould definitely suggest to visit them with your family and friends.\nLive music was an added plus. üòÑ",

The servers are very polite and suggested delicious food.\nThis hidden gem is worth visiting and I cannot praise Mahen enough for his business since it is less than 10yrs old. He is very polite and even greeted us when we were having our food.\n\nThey also have a family cafe called Praveen Cafe which was opened by his father, I would recommend to try it as well.",
