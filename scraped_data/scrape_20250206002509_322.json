When I called the restaurant, they denied it, saying their restaurant is open 24 hours, so how could the food be stale? Is this a joke? The oil they use is of poor quality, and the owner has no manners",

Even though it may appear that the place is for truck drivers, the taste is amazing. Cholle masala, Gobi manchurian, paneer tikka masala and paneer chilli were amazing, I heard positive review about daal baati from my friends but you have to order for it 1 hour prior. The only mistake you can not commit is ordering Special thali, some friends regretted their decision.",
