We had to ask for sambar three times, and instead of serving us politely, the server rudely questioned why we were asking so often and even yelled at us. When we complained, the situation escalated with the server yelling at the owner, who in turn, softly scolded him, but it made no difference.\n\nThe food was below average, far from what you’d expect at a vegetarian restaurant, and the ambiance was absolutely awful. It was an all-around unpleasant experience, and I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone. Save yourself the disappointment and avoid this hotel at all costs!",

The food was good but the service was pathetic that the waiters were very rude and took a long time to deliver the food. But I had a train to catch in another thirty minutes so I asked them to parcel the food. They had parcelled the hot food in a very low quality plastic cover even without spoon, tissue or any other cutlery. It was damn poor and felt really disgusting while opening the pack in train. Never recommend this place to anyone",
