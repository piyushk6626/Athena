The staff is a little casual and could not properly explain in details about the dish send they were not much aware about their own menus. But overall a nice restaurant.",

The atmosphere is like any other beach shack without music which leaves u with the sound of nature which is nice and calming..\nThe Menu is quite simple and small...the food on the other hand is not as flavour full as they claim to be ordered alot of starters eg: muscle rava fry , pork chilli fry , chonok rava fry bombay ducks and squid butter garlic ...the pork chilly was decent the rest fried stuff had the same taste to it...for mains ordered ambot tik and xacuti both of which were average. .i hope the add some goan flavours to the curries and other dishes....its a lovely location but lacks quality of food... the service was normal like any other place staff were kind and welcoming. ended up with a bill of 5500 which was a little high compared to the standard of food ..other than that if u just want to chill and admire the river sip on a beer or alcohol ita a lovely location...",

This sea-facing restaurant is perfect for a laid-back meal—no loud music, just the sound of waves and plenty of room for actual conversations. It’s the kind of place where time slows down, and you won’t want to leave.\n\nThe food? Absolute gold. The seafood is super fresh, and the Goan chorizo fry is a flavor bomb—spicy, smoky, and so addictive. But the real star of the show? Their urak. This local drink is light, citrusy, and insanely refreshing. Pair it with the food, and you’ve got a winning combo.\n\nBabazin is perfect for a lazy afternoon or a chilled sunset meal. Great food, great drinks, great view—what else do you need?\n\nPS: Gobbled up the food too quick to click pictures but here’s the chorizo pulao, Pomfret fry and Sorpotel. All amazing!",
