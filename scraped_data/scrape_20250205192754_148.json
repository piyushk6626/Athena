Their best-sellers are a must-try; you won’t regret it!\n\nThe staff here is incredibly polite and friendly, making the visit even more enjoyable. The ambiance is great, offering a perfect setting to relax and enjoy your meal.\n\nOverall, I’m very happy with my experience and would highly recommend this place to anyone craving delicious pizza and excellent service. Can’t wait to visit again!",

The problem with this place is that there is no separate entry for Swiggy or  zomato guys to pick up their parcels, they all come at the cash counter to pick up their orders . Though the bill staff Sumitra was excellent",

Both pizzas were cold even though we were just across the street . Not at all Pizza Hut quality.\n\nTomato base sauce tasted old and stale.\n\nNo oregano or chill flakes provided by them.\n\nNo chilled coke available, had to order a warm coke and sprite.\n\nDisappointed",
