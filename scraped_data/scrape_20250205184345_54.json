            "review_text": "Went to this famous cafe in Tonca on 13th November 2024. The cafe was small yet unique with many pictures and arts of western culture as well as famous musicians. We played Uno there while we waited for waiter to take our order. Even after playing a long game, no one came to take our order. It was only after that, we knocked on door calling someone to take our order. The owner came and told us he was on short of staff for that and order to take time to come. We agreed as we had no plans of rushing back home. We tried their cheesy fries, BBQ burger, corn sandwich, steak bread, oreo shake and lime soda.\nBurgers and sandwiches were very tasty and oreo shake was top notch. Steak bread was not tasty at all.",
