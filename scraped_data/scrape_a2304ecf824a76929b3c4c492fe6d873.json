We ordered the Pepperoni Pizza, Fish and Chips, and Cappuccinos.\n\nThe Pepperoni Pizza was overly salty, with a thin and hard base. While it was edible, the texture made it less enjoyable.\n\nThe Fish and Chips was initially served with the fish raw in the center. Although the staff apologized and replaced it, the second serving, while cooked, was unseasoned, both in the fish and the batter. The large size of the fish fillet seems to contribute to the cooking issues, as it makes it challenging to prepare evenly.\n\nThe Cappuccinos were a disappointment, arriving lukewarm and lacking the comforting warmth one would expect.\n\nThe real highlight of the evening, however, was the in-house parrot, which provided some unexpected entertainment by flying to a guest's table and stealing their fish!  ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£\n\nOn a positive note, the ambience of Oh La La is stunning. The dÃ©cor is tastefully done, creating a beautiful and inviting atmosphere.\n\nWhile the setting is remarkable, the food quality needs significant improvement to encourage repeat visits. A better focus on seasoning, preparation, and attention to detail in serving could elevate the overall dining experience.",
