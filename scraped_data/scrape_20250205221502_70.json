The ambiance was good and the seating arrangement was comfortable, making it an ideal spot for a  relaxed meal.\nWe ordered the Special North Indian Thali and Gobi Manchurian, both of which were delicious.\nDespite the restaurant being moderately busy, we didn't have to wait for a long time.\nOverall this place is a fantastic choice for anyone looking for a wide variety of flavorful vegetarian food.",

We ordered channa puri know as Patal bhaji in Goa. which was delicious but veg briyani was tasteless. Bad experience with briyani. Ambiance not so good even in AC seating. Overall mix experience but I will suggest to visit other places if you are vegetarian and looking for options in panji or don't briyani here.",
