The restaurant offers subtle lighting, which not only creates a cozy atmosphere but is also perfect for Instagram-worthy pictures. The river view adds to the charm, making it a great place to unwind. The food is delicious, with a good variety of options, and the prices are quite reasonable. A perfect blend of ambiance and quality food!",

The Ambience is calm and Serene, they always have a good gig going on in the evenings. It was our Happy unwinding location.\n\nHowever, this time 1st January 2025, it was a terrible experience, which left a bad taste especially when you were entertaining guests from outside.\nWe arrived as early as 1230 noon time\nAll waterfront tables were marked as reserved,  except an 10 seater table we were 6 persons including 02 super senior citizens. As there was no one to guide or ask us , We occupied the said 10 seater. After some time, a person in white shirt came over to us ( didn't get his name ) asking to vacate the table as it was reserved. We asked him there was no reservation tab kept on it, and we occupied this as the rest had the Reserve tab. We agreed to oblige his request but asked him to accommodate us on the adjacent 6 seater table, which he refused to acknowledge saying this is reserved for other guests, as per the Owners list. We asked to speak to the owner but they just turned a deaf ear. Ultimately, we left the place as it was very embarrassing  and humiliating not only to us as human beings but also to our guests.\nThe Owner seriously need to keep a tab on their staff behaviour, there was  not an ounce of an apology even when asking us to get off the tables.\nWhat a start to a new year 2025. This restaurant is not crossed off our list for Good.\nWe have had some really good times here, including but not limited to  birthday parties.",
