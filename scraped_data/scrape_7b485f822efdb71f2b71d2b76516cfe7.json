The 'sukka' and fried piece of fish or prrawn are very tasty. The fried Prawn are big in size and coated with Rawa masala, there is no option available to customise to non rava masala.\n\nThe shells and gravy are good too and goes well with steam rice they are served with. The yummy Sol Kadhi is brilliant to end your thali.",

It was definitely worth the money.\nHowever, the service left a lot to be desired. We arrived when they were about to close, but they assured us they would still serve us. Instead, we ended up waiting for an hour, which was quite frustratingâ€”we could have gone to another place if they had just been honest about being closed.\n\nAdditionally, the waiters were unprofessional, even jokingly offering beer to my four-year-old nephew. This kind of behavior is not acceptable.\n\nThe food is great, but the service needs serious attention.",
