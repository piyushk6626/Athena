It's known for the Bakasur Thali and Agadbam Thali.\nLocation is good, near to Sun Inn Hotel.\nParking is available on roadside.\nAmbience is good, with small statues outside of fishermen, where you can click photos for Facebook and insta posts. Inside it is comfortable with good AC and nice comfortable seating. There is Bar section towards the right side.\nFood: I tried the chicken Thali. It was very tasty and fulfilling. 2 chapatis are very good size. My stomach was full.\nService: The waiters are decent and good.\nThey provide finger bowl also after dinner",
