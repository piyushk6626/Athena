Given the scarcity of eateries along this highway, it‚Äôs a convenient and valuable stop for travelers.\n\nFinding a good place right on the highway with ample parking was a relief. The restaurant is clean and offers a wide variety of food items at reasonable prices.\n\nFor lunch, we ordered Dal Khichdi, which was served piping hot and fresh‚Äîit was delicious. We also tried the mini Thali, which was quite good. For breakfast the previous day, we had Dosa and Poori Bhaji‚Äîboth were tasty and enjoyable.\n\nOverall, Aashram Pure Vegetarian Restaurant is a reliable dining option for travelers on NH 66, offering tasty and reasonably priced meals in a clean and accessible setting.",
