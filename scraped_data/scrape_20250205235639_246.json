King fish thali, lepo fry, squid rava fry, paneer tikka masala. I was totally famished. Had ridden my bicycle almost 65km this morning and had skipped breakfast too. I waited and waited and waited some more. After almost what seemed an eternity( it was maybe 50-55 minutes) I got my order and off I went. Got home. Packing was perfect. Nothing had leaked or spilled. The food was‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ WOW! I polished off my plate. Was it worth the long wait? Definitely! I‚Äôd suggest calling ahead and placing the order so that you don‚Äôt have to wait.",
