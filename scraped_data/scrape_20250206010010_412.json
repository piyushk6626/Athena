Saw a lot of cars parked so immediately stopped the car, checked the reviews and walked in with fingers crossed. What you notice is the new set up and the staff getting acclimatized themselves. So everyone was a bit nervous and on their toes. The food took a long time to arrive, The chonak masala preparation was fantastic. The fish wasn't that fresh, understood that it is a rainy season. The quantity of fish was less too. Chilly chicken was good. Fried was good too but there was a slight fishy flavour, probably because of the utensils used. The ambience is 5 on 5, and if it rains it is even better. Overall a good place to have a relaxed evening.",
