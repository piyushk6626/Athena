Everything is crafted in-house, from the freshly baked bread to the syrups that elevate their cocktails. You can tell the difference‚Äîevery dish and drink feels thoughtfully prepared with the finest ingredients. Their cocktails, in particular, are a must-try!\n\nThe service was just as impressive. Kimberley and Pravin are super friendly, knowledgeable, and really go out of their way to make sure you‚Äôre having a great time.\n\nIf you‚Äôre visiting Goa, Senses should definitely be on your list. It‚Äôs the kind of place that leaves you wanting to come back again and again!",
