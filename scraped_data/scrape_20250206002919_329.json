            "review_text": "We recently dined at Cohin in Goa on a Saturday evening. Surprisingly, the place was deserted as there was some local religious festival being hosted in various parts of the city that evening.\nAmbience: Located right next to the creek, the ambience was serene and the lights and decor added to the charm. I believe it would be an equally charming place to dine in during the day.\nFood: The food was a fusion of local cuisine with unexpected flavours. The presentation was top-notch and shows the chef's attention to detail. We were pleasantly surprised by the infusion of flavours, especially in the vegetarian dishes.\nService: Only area of improvement would be to have more knowledgeable staff who are better acquainted with the menu.  Again, wasn't a negative experience just something to look out for by the proprietors to provide a more comfortable experience to customers.\nOverall, I'd definitely recommend Cohin for a eclectic dining experience.",

            "review_text": "We had an incredible dining experience at Cochin Goa! We ordered the roasted chicken with truffle oil and porcini mushrooms, and it was cooked to perfection with rich flavors that left us wanting more. Their chicken pizza was equally delightful, with a perfect crust and generous toppings. To top it off, we enjoyed some refreshing Long Island Iced Teas (LITs), which were perfectly balanced.\n\nThe ambiance added to the experience, with its cozy yet vibrant vibe that made the evening truly special. Every aspect of our visit was amazing—from the food to the drinks and the atmosphere. Highly recommend this place if you’re looking for a great time in Goa!",
