I have been in India for over 2 1/2 months, and my dinner here yesterday was the best meal I’ve had since I’ve been here! I would come eat at this restaurant even if I wasn’t staying at this hotel. 100/10 recommend to everyone, not just vegetarians!",

The moment you sit down, you are welcomed with traditional hospitality and a beautifully arranged platter that showcases the rich diversity of Rajasthani cuisine.\n\nThe Thali offers an incredible variety of dishes, each packed with bold flavors and spices that reflect the heritage of Rajasthan. The gatte ki sabzi and ker sangri were equally delightful, with their unique textures and rich gravy.\n\nAccompaniments like papad, kadhi, and raita provide a refreshing contrast to the spicy curries. The assortment of rotis and missi roti, along with fluffy rice, complemented the meal perfectly. The thali ends with a sweet note of Gulab Jamun and chocolate ice cream, which adds a perfect finish.\n\nThe ambiance of the hotel complements the food, with traditional Rajasthani decor and attentive staff who ensure you are well taken care of throughout the meal. For anyone looking to indulge in the essence of Rajasthan, the Rajasthani Thali at Aur Jalsa is an experience you won’t want to miss.",

And probably the best vegetarian food I’ve ever had.\n\nWe went twice and both times were 10/10, even with a different menu. Picture doesn’t really do it justice.\nIt’s a set menu but you can order as much as you want. 10000/10 would recommend!!!!",
