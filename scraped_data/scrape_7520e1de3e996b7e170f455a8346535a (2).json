You’ll need to rely on paid parking along the main road, which can be inconvenient.\n\nFood Quality:\nIf you’re a die-hard Maharashtrian seafood lover, this place will likely disappoint. Despite paying more than ₹250 for a fish thali, the portions and quality are underwhelming.\n\nFish Thali: Thin fish pieces and an unnecessary addition of chana masala. The single dry chapati included in the thali feels stingy.\n\nSolekadhi: A complete letdown; it’s more like kokam water than the rich, flavorful drink it’s supposed to be.\n\nGoan Curry: It’s just average and doesn’t add much value to the overall meal experience.\n\nValue for Money:\nThe pricing does not justify the quality or portion size of the food.\n\nOverall, Hotel Anandashram lacks the charm and authenticity expected from a seafood-centric establishment. It may work for a quick, basic meal, but not for someone seeking an enjoyable dining experience.",
