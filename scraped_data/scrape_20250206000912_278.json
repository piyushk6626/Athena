Its not your regular shawarma place serving just normal and spicy shawarma. They have a wide menu to choose from. The prices are super affordable too! If you are in Panjim you definitely need to drop by here! Mr Seby has been running this place since 1999 brining shawarma to goa much before. The shawarmas are prepared taking care of all hygiene standards, from gloves, mask to head net. Here‚Äôs what we tried at LaFansa Cafe:\n\n*Cheesy Shawarma: 130/-\n*Mexican Shawarma: 100/-\n*Normal Shawarma: 90/-\nThe cheesy shawarma was the bomb with juicy meat, vegetables, olives and sauces that were so delicious. If you do not love spicy stuff then we definitely recommend trying this out. It definitely wont fail to please. However if you can handle spice, Mexican shawarma is the one for you. There was just an explosion of spice in the mouth which was so satisfying! Lafansa cafe really know how to make lip smacking shawarmas, as their Normal shawarma too was delicious but not as filling as compared to the other two.\n\nWe recommend visiting here! There is always a crowd even on weekdays but the wait time is less because of their super fast preparation. For more check out our Instagram at @cuisine_goa",
