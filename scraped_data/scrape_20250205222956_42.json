Unfortunately, I fail to recall the names of our cocktails or of the food but I do know that they were extremely delicious and that we had a great time consuming them. As the night wore on, a local band serenaded us with some lovely songs. It was a perfect place to enjoy a lovely evening.",

All dishes were superb. One could see that choicest ingredients were used.\nMy mom, who was fasting, ordered the milkshake, which was prepared to her liking along with some French fries. It was a nice place to spend the evening with friends and family over shared plates.\nRecommended :)",
