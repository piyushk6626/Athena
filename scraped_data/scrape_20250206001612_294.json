            "review_text": "Brilliant little restaurant tucked away near the shores of Utorda.\n\nWe arrived as soon as they opened for their evening service. We were a party of 6 adults and 2 children. Greeted by a lovely gentleman, who sat us down and joined two tables together to accommodate us.\n\nThe service and atmosphere was great. The waiter always tentative to our request. The venue is nice and quiet, just a few minutes walk inland, from the beach.\n\nThe food was delicious with big portions, having us all leaving stuffed and satisfied. Prices were a tiny bit lower here compared to the other places in this area (as you would expect being near the beach) but well worth it.\n\nWe will definitely return.",

Be it a Goan beef chilli or their special chilli squids or  tandoor pork ribs.. they do it all with ease .. and leave you wanting more.\nEvery item we ate - the chicken lollipops, the kerala style meat xacuti, the salt and pepper tongue .. ðŸ¤¯ all of it were just lip-smacking. This is truly a place that you're gonna keep going back to.",
