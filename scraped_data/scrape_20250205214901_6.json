Here we order mushroom xacuti & parota, jeera rice and serradura.\n\nI liked serradura & mushroom xacuti but felt parota & jeera rice were not fresh. Although waiter was honest person he told us what is best to eat and fresh. The best time is after 12 pm to 4 pm things are freshly serve here and available. Ambiance is nice but still need few things to fix as they are renowned veg food chain in Goa.",

Rates are very economical comparing the overall standard of nearby restaurants. Limited parking space available. They have a cashback programme which can be redeemed on your next visit.\n\nThe main drawback is the congested dining area. Overall a good breakfast option.",
