We had tried the Tandoori Chicken, Mushroom Crispy, and Chicken Fried Rice. Chicken Fried rice was really nice. Liked the rice and veggies that they added. Brought together nicely Tandoori too was nice. Prices are reasonable.",

The Chicken Fried Rice had a pleasant taste; the vegetables provided a nice crunch, and the chicken was flavorful. The Vegetable Chilly was also good. The overall ambience was pleasing, with a nice interior setting that added to the dining experience.",

There is a separate AC area too, if incase you feel humid & hot sitting at the open area.\n\nWe tried the non-vegetarian and vegetarian options, both and the food was delicious. Recommended!",
