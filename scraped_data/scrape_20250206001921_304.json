Pavan approached us and asked about our choices and suggested the best choices and freshest seafood. The food was ample and really tasty.\nPlus being the liquor is priced the most affordable prices when compared to most Goan restaurants.\nMuch recommended to visit! ‚úåÔ∏è",

The other side of the restaurant is fine. We ordered kingfish thali. Its price was 320/- which i felt was on the higher side. They take a minimum of 15mins for service. Curry wasn't good enough. However the rest of the food was tasty. We received a good portion of kingfish. You just need to have patience, rest the food is fine.",
