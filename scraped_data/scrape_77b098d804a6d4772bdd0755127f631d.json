The menu offered a variety of seafood options, and I opted for the Fish Thali, Prawns, and Chonak Thali.\n\nThe taste of the dishes was good, but the fish curry could have been improved. However, the other dishes, such as the Tisrio and Crab Curry, were delicious.\n\nThe ambiance was lovely, making for a comfortable dining experience.\n\nThe prices were pocket-friendly, offering great value for money.\n\nThe service was good, with friendly staff attending to our needs.\n\nAmple parking space was available, making it convenient for customers.\n\nOverall, I would recommend Ranche Ghar for its good food, lovely ambiance, and affordable prices.",

Normal thali prawns rs 220.All the items served were well made n delicious.\nAmbience was good and ample seating space.\nService was quick and prompt. Would definitely recommend to visit this place and try out the various  items in their menu. Good job please keep it up.",

            "review_text": "We ordered the King Fish Thali, Squids Better Fry, and Lime Soda. The first thing that stood out negatively was the inclusion of chapati in the fish thali. In a traditional Goan fish thali, chapati is not served. Additionally, the prawns curry in the thali lacked flavor and was quite disappointing. The highlight of any Goan fish thali is usually the curry, but unfortunately, the curry here didn’t meet expectations.\n\nThe Squids Better Fry was decent, though I wouldn’t describe it as extraordinary—just an average taste.\n\nOverall, I felt the place is somewhat overrated. For the same price, there are plenty of other establishments that offer a better dining experience with superior flavors.",
