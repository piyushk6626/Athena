            "review_text": "These are phenomenal hamburgers. I certainly can't get burgers like this in Bangalore, which is why back home I usually make my own.\n\nI'm often suspicious of gourmet burgers because they \"try too hard\" (my own hamburger is mayo/mustard/tomato/pickles) - but I thought I would give these guys a chance and I ordered the one with pomegranate and guacamole\n\nThe buns are perfect, when you bite into the sesame seeds you can taste the toasted sesame. The ratio of bun to meat is just right, the bun doesn't fall apart but tears just when you want it to. The beef was juicy with no gristle,  and the topping of lettuce-cabbage-tomato-onion-capsicum looked complicated but was just right.\n\nMy son got a pork burger, and I usually don't eat pork burgers but I tried his and WOW am I glad I did. This one had a little gristle but their combination of mustard and barbecue sauce was top. I took several bites before putting it down\n\nWhat else... the fried pickles were cute, the chips stayed crunchy but I would have still preferred french fries. Their air conditioning was effective and the bathroom was clean\n\nAnd finally, was it expensive? The burgers were around 600 each (?) which I think was justified, my son's juice was approx. 200 which I thought was overpriced, and my wife got wine which cost whatever. I mean, it was fine",
