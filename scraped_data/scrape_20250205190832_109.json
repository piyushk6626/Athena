It's a decent choice for dining in Ponda, but patience with the service is necessary. The restaurant has potential, but attention to detail and efficiency would enhance the experience significantly.",

This time we had simple ,\n*veg kadai which was spicy enough and tasty portion was enough for 2-3    people.\n*King fish fry- fish was ok not wow small 4 prices of king fish.\n* Chicken rava fry-  price to quantity ratio I would say quantity is less and   small pieces thin slices.\n*Roti- were medium soft .\nOverall - i would rate it 3.8 out of 5 overall quality of food is satisfactory and taste is decent enough, ambience is simple service is quick.",
