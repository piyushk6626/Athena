I visited this place so many times no matter whether itâ€™s breakfast, lunch or dinner.\n\nI had very less hopes for dal khichdi in goa but this place made me realise how amazing their food is by proving to sell best dal khichdi in town.\n\nI have tried their most of the dishes and everything is just delicious.\n\nGo for anything you like here, I am pretty sure that will be really delicious.",
