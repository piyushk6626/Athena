It's the perfect spot to enjoy a beautiful sunset with you Buddies. They even have professional photographers who took pictures of our group. When we asked how to get the pictures, Manpreet shared her number with us and told us to check with her in 2-3 days. As promised, she shared the Google Drive link to our incredible pictures. Here are a few of them. The best part is that they didn't charge anything extra for the photos. Many thanks to Manpreet and Mea for providing such a delightful experience!",
