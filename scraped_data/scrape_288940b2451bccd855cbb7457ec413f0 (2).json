The place is quite popular and can get very crowded, especially during lunch hours, so it’s almost guaranteed that you’ll end up on the waiting list for a table. The parking situation is also challenging, with limited spaces available nearby.\n\nDue to the crowd, the staff might occasionally overlook some small details in your order, but they more than make up for it with their incredibly swift service. The food arrives quickly, beautifully presented, and prepared with evident care. However, the portions are on the smaller side, and the prices are a bit steep for the quantity served.\n\nOverall, it was a good experience, thanks to the speedy service and quality presentation, but be prepared for the busy environment and premium pricing.",
