We had teriyaki chicken (which was good), oriental fried, chicken yakitori, pepper chicken, and chicken twister were all decent. Chicken Tikka masala was really good, especially with stuffed cheese garlic naan!",

The only dish I really enjoyed was the stuffed mushrooms. Unfortunately, the rest of the menu didnâ€™t impress me.\nThe waiters were quite rude, which detracted from the overall experience. The place has potential, but the service and the majority of the food need significant improvement.",

So the first time we were there they didnt have any tables available. So I would suggest making reservations in advance. But other than that I have nothing but high praises to share about this place. The ambience of The Farmhouse Restaurant is welcoming and warm. This restaurant has a certain rustic charm that is very inviting, the wooden furniture, the vintage lamps give a very cozy, and home like vibe while dining. The food here as well was exquisite. We ordered mocktails, I would recommend the blue lagoon and Red Sula Wine for bevrages. In starters I really enjoyed the Chicken Twisters and the Veg Spring Rolls. The sauce served with the spring rolls was delicious. As for main course I liked the Alfredo Pasta, & the Paneer Masala as well. The service was also amazing and the staff was also professional, polite mindful and demure. The Farmhouse Restaurant serves a fine dining experience that you wont forget",
