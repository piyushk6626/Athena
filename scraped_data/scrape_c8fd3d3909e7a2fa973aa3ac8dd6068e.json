In the middle of my meal, the staff (a lady) asked me to get up and repark my car, even though there were no signs indicating where parking was or wasnâ€™t allowed.\n\nIt was frustrating and completely disrupted the dining experience.\n\nThe food deserves a better service team, and I hope they improve their customer handling in the future.",

Located really close to Dabolim airport this place takes you to another realm due to its design sense and green vegetation.\nThe first impression was wow what a place.\n\nThe next wow wow happened when we tasted the food.\nThis is a place you can spend hours chilling and enjoying the vibe and cuisine. They serve continental and Asian menu. Known for excellent Baos.",
