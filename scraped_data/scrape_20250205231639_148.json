I’ve been here multiple times, and while the pricing is reasonable, the food quality matches what you pay for. It’s not the most delicious out there, but it’s decent, with consistency at a good 80-90% of the time.\n\nSpeaking specifically about this outlet, the staff experience is mixed—50% are diligent and maintain hygiene, while the other 50% seem indifferent, either bored or working just for the paycheck. You can tell from their demeanor and lack of attention to cleanliness. Management should take this seriously, as this outlet has potential, but a few careless staff members could tarnish the brand’s reputation.\n\nI’ve noticed unclean tables and cockroaches on multiple occasions(Top Section), and poor hygiene practices among some kitchen staff. This needs urgent attention to improve the overall experience.\n\nIf you want to experience the best of Temptation, I’d recommend visiting their Margao store instead.",

They have baguettes, soft rolls, sandwiches,cheesecakes, cakes ,snacks , coffee,tea..etc...all priced between 20-200\n\nFrom the sitting area you can spot Indian Air force jets, helicopters.",
