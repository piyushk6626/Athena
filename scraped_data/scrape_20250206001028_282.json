Not enough and dedicated space to parking.\nAlso they are selling packaged drinking water bottle at 50rs. I mean it‚Äôs  ridiculous.\n\nHighly recommended starter dish - prawns fry with green stuffing. Food was really great.üëç",

We were delighted to stumble upon this hidden gem, situated on the main road, showcasing stunning architecture that pays homage to Portuguese culture. This restaurant, housed in a converted heritage home, specializes in authentic Saraswat-style Goan cuisine, which left us thoroughly impressed. We opted for their signature fish thali, comprising rice, curry, two bhajis, sol Kadi, pickle, salad, kismoor, papad, sweet dish, three large rava fried prawns, and fish filet. Additionally, we tried the stuffed muscle, which was equally delectable. The restaurant's beautifully designed ambiance exudes a relaxed Goan vibe, making it a must-visit destination when in Nerul.",
