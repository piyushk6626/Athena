We tried their non-veg thali, kingfish thali, tandoori naan, chicken vindaloo prepared with extreme care. Food was tasty, Anand was so polite and friendly. He took the time and assisted us to select the menu every time.",

Service was extraordinary - Anand was very friendly and helpful. Informed us also about busy kitchen in advance. Local music playing, opened 24/7. Busy road next to restaurant is little disadvantage, but here in India this can be overlooked ;)",

The fish was old and stale, while the fried rice looked more like instant noodles than proper fried rice. I complained to the staff, but they showed no response, almost as if they were already aware of the issue. Definitely not recommended for tourists – there are plenty of better restaurants to try elsewhere in GOA.",
