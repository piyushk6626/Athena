The food was outstanding ‚Äì the dosas were perfectly crispy, the idlis were soft and fluffy.The service was quick and efficient, with friendly staff who offered excellent recommendations.  The cleanliness of the restaurant is also commendable. Annapoorna is now my go-to spot for authentic South Indian cuisine. Highly recommend!",
