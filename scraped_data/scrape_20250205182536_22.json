The ambience is good in AC as well as the breezy non-AC section. I preferred the cool natural breezy area. I tried the squid golden fry, chonaak rava fry which was fresh and crispy. Among the drinks, Cinderella was very sweet having only the taste of the slice.The gimlet was good but the quantity was very less.  One must try the chicken 65 at this place which has a good taste. Coriander chicken is nice and yummy, a must try here. The service is great here. The waiters are very polite and welcoming. Overall a good place to visit with family or friends.\n\n•Trip type: Dinner with Friends\n\n•Service: 3.0\n\n•Location: 3.5\n\n•Hotel highlights: Nice place suited for family & friends.\n\n•Walkability: No walking distance; it's Just on the road with good enough inhouse free parking.",
