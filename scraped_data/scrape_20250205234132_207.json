I had to order 2 qty for 1. Breakfast is tasty. Newer items like idli/dosa etc. In menu. But availability a serious issue. Service is slow esp. In AC section. Veg thali is quiet wholesome. One of the best. Evening hard to get anything hot to eat. Wadas, samosas, Mirchies made in the morning served cold. The dosa also served is cold. Would recommend for visiting it for breakfast and veg lunch. Open on sundays (morning half).",

They have the main outlet at St. Inez which is small yet dishes out best and yummy food. This is a new one, good enough place to sit and enjoy",
