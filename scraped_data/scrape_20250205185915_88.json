I was quite impressed by the striking interiors and artwork to reflect the pan-American cuisine. The space is open and inviting with the dining furniture comprising solid tables and chairs as well as diner style booths.\nThe staff was courteous and accommodating. We had dietary restrictions and the chef was able to conform to our requests. The food quality and taste was not compromised. Our custom order thin crust vegan pizza was a winner!\nThe cocktails are amazing.\nA special shout out to Chetana for ensuring our experience was enjoyable!",

We ordered the Route 66 burger and Veg primavera pizza - both of which were amazing. Price was on the higher side though.\nThe cocktails were poorly made with bad taste. Not worth the price at all.\nWon't recommend this place for drinks but only for the food.",

The decor is bit confusing between a pop-rock and Texan style and bit dated looking. However the 90s music was really nice. The hamburgers luckily were still the old style way and they had not lost their touch here. Served typically with a knife to cut the hamburger. Had the chicken roxette, pork fat boy and beef route 66 special served with old style coke bottles.",
