Although we arrived a little late, around 4 PM, and the kitchen was about to close, they were still willing to take our orders.\nWe ordered a variety of dishes, including a veg thali, fish thali, chicken fried rice, chicken tikka masala, butter roti, and fresh lime juice.\nThe food was delicious, and we left feeling very satisfied.\nThe place has a cozy atmosphere and captures the old Goan vibe perfectly.",
