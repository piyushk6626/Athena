            "review_text": "If you're a seafood lover looking for an authentic local Goan dining experience, Mahesh Bar and Restaurant should be on your list! Nestled in the heart of Ramnathi, Bandoda, Goa 403401, this iconic spot combines simplicity with rich, flavorful cuisine that speaks volumes.\n\nAmbience üå¥‚ú®\nThe atmosphere is laid-back and welcoming, reflecting the essence of a classic Goan Tavern. Wooden interiors, warm dim lighting, and a buzz of lively conversations make it a perfect spot for both casual family dinners and catching up with friends over drinks.\n\nFood üêüüçõ\nThe star of the show is, undoubtedly, their seafood. I tried their Rava fried Prawns, Rava fried kingfish, Rava fried Chonak, Rava fried Mussels, Rava fried Vellyo and all were nothing short of spectacular. The prawns were perfectly cooked while the other fishes had a crisp, golden crust and a melt-in-your-mouth texture.\n\nTheir Fish Thali is average as per me ‚Äîan assortment of local flavors served with rice, curry, fried fish, and salad that give you a true taste of Goan coastal cuisine.\n\nFor those who prefer non-seafood options, the Chicken Xacuti is a flavor bomb with its rich coconut and spice blend.\n\nAnd the star of the show in Chicken Category : Goan Chilly chicken. Absolutely delicious.\n\nDrinks üçπ\nTheir bar menu is extensive, offering everything from classic whiskeys to local feni-based concoctions.\n\nService üòä\nThe staff is friendly and attentive, always ready to offer recommendations or tweak dishes to your preference. Service is prompt despite the popularity of the place.\n\nPrice üí∏\nConsidering the quality and quantity, Mahesh Bar and Restaurant offers excellent value for money. Expect to spend around ‚Çπ800-‚Çπ1,200 for two, including drinks.\n\nFinal Verdict ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\nMahesh Bar and Restaurant offers an authentic Goan dining experience with lip-smacking seafood, a cozy atmosphere, and great service. It's a place that celebrates local Goan tavern flavors in every bite. Highly recommended for locals and tourists alike!\n\nFood Freshness : 5/5\nService : 5/5\nAmbiance : 4/5\nFood Taste : 5/5\nPrice : Reasonable",

The quiet lane and simple facade doesn't reveal the many tiny rooms inside, full of locals getting a swig or two of local spirits before heading home for the day - but the line of cars parked outside is definitely an indication of how popular it is.\n\nI really enjoyed their chilly chicken, which could be considered expensive for the portion size. You have to try it when you go. The fish is extremely fresh and large - making it a satisfying accomplishment to your drink. Most of it is masala rava fried - so while some would say it's same-same-but-different, for a local bar, it gets a pass.\n\nThey ran out of prawns before we got there, which is a pity because I bet they would have been banging. ü§§\n\nFollow @thatgoangirl for more",
