The waiters were very helpful. We had some really lovely food - they sometimes change the cuisine but when we went it was \"Coastal India\" so flavours from the coast. The recheado was very good (and hot!) but we preferred the balchao as it was slightly milder. My partner is vegan and they could make most of the curries vegan and even a vegan paratha for her.",

We have had an amazing crab singapore style which was specially prepared by the chef for us and it was spectacular. However, during our most recent visit, the crab was grossly overcooked and the flesh was almost runny üôÅ. Leaving that aside, we have had good ceviche, grilled prawns and some nice desserts here. The hookah is also really good. They have also changed the menu in Sept 2023",
