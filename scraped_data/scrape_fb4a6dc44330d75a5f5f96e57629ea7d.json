However, when a delivery guy arrived, he received an order with fries.\n\nWhen I asked the staff about this, they informed me that fries were only available for delivery orders. I was shocked and frustrated by this inconsistent policy.\n\nAs a customer, I expect to receive the same service and options as anyone else, regardless of whether I'm dining in or ordering for delivery. This experience fell short of my expectations.\n\nI hope you can look into this matter and ensure that your policies are fair and consistent for all customers.",
