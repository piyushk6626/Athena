Everything was so good. For mains we had pesto pizza, pork sandwich, pork burger and a big fat platter. Everything swept us away with a lot of deliciousness. Fantastic. Reduced one star only for pricing. But absolutely worth it.",

We ordered the Aglio Olio Spaghetti and Barbecue Chicken Wings, both of which were delicious and served in generous portions. The flavors were spot on, and the food quality exceeded our expectations.\n\nThe service was excellent – the waiter was friendly and attentive, ensuring we had a comfortable dining experience. The restaurant offers good parking space, and the ambience was cozy and inviting, making it a perfect spot for a relaxed evening. The prices were reasonable, especially considering the quantity and quality of the food.\n\nAlthough we found the locals in Goa not very friendly, restaurants like Big Fat Sandwich definitely make up for it. Highly recommend this place for a satisfying meal and great service!",

The atmosphere is cozy and welcoming, making it a perfect place to relax with friends or family. I ordered Grandma's Special Chicken Sandwich (a fried chicken sandwich), a classic Margherita pizza with onions, and a cappuccino. The sandwich was fantastic, featuring crispy fried chicken and a wonderful mix of flavors. The Margherita pizza was also delicious, and the addition of onions gave it a nice twist that I appreciated. The cappuccino was well-prepared and paired nicely with the meal. The service was friendly and efficient, and the prices were fair for the quality of food provided. However, the place can get quite busy, so be ready for a bit of a wait during peak times. Overall, Big Fat Sandwich is a great option if you're looking for a satisfying meal in Goa. I’ll definitely return to try more items from their menu!\n\nThey have car parking in front of the restaurant and a guy to help you park.",
