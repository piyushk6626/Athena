Go there you will definitely enjoy.\nFirst timeüëáüèº\nI was alone and wasn‚Äôt the best time to explore. My taxi driver said it‚Äôs good basis on he has seen lots of people there. That‚Äôs right. Ambience and music along with the location brings some charm. I ordered prawns and manchow soup . Both were good. Coconut Daiquiri was nice too. Very well presented food. One star less because their French fries tasted like cardboard. But over all a nice experience and a beautiful evening.",
