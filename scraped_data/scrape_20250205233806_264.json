The estate is a historic restoration project and is modest and kept as authentic to its time period as possible by its current residents/owners. The food was the type of  Goan - Portuguese cuisine you'd only get when invited to someones home here. The gardens on the property are beautiful and home to some well pruned pretty wildflowers , The lunch spot is surrounded by gorgeous old monsteras and Elephant ear colocasias . It's pretty and idyllic and perfect for a quiet afternoon with some quality company and amazing food (Call in advance to book a lunch and/or tour , they don't take walk ins for either)",

The mansion is stunning and we enjoyed learning about its history and the fantastic restoration efforts by Mr. Ruben and his family. The meal that followed the tour was among the best we've had in our week-long stay in Goa. The Indo-Portugese spread was huge and each dish was delicious. We especially loved the stuffed crab, the prawn caldine, the avocado and pomelo salad, the drinks and the chocolate cake. The soup and feni cocktails were great, too! To put it simply, the entire meal was fabulous! üòä\n\nThanks once again to Mr. Ruben for a wonderful experience!",
