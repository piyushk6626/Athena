There is an ample amount of seating available on any given day but I would recommend this place during the wee hours as they have chefs available at that point of time. In between times such as 3 PM or something which is neither lunch nor tea, one will find most of the foods and dishes not available as they are preparing for something larger and that is dinner. All in all, I would recommend this place if you are visiting Palolem.",
