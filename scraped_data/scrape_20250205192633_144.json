But now, the quality of food is still not bad but the service has gone worse. The service is slow and you have to remind them of your order again and again and this happened when this place was not even crowded. The staff were all out front passing time and no one cared of the order to be served. Saw this happening with a couple of other customers also during my visit today.",
