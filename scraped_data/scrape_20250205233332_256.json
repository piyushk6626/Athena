The service staff is also helpful and prompt. The momos outer covering was the perfect thickness, and it was the best experience when we had the hot momos during a rainy night. The mushroom soup was actually a clear soup, but it was not mentioned in the menu. The egg fried rice was also great. There were a lot of spicy items, so I felt they could have kept some non spicy items too. Overall a good place that I recommend visiting.",
