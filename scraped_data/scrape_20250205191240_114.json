            "review_text": "Updated review\n\nYour shack might look great, but the food and service were absolutely terrible. Here's the reality you need to face:\n\n- The food was inedible‚Äîvegetarian items were stinking, the salad was stale, and the overall quality was shockingly bad.\n\n- The service was the worst‚Äîyour staff didn‚Äôt listen to any of the concerns we raised and acted completely uninterested in resolving them.\n\nDespite pointing out the issues to your waiter, we were ignored. Instead of addressing the situation, we were handed a ‚Çπ2800 bill without so much as an apology or any consideration for the poor experience.\n\nWhat‚Äôs even worse is your attitude. You seem to think that anyone posting a negative review about your shack doesn‚Äôt understand food quality or service standards. That mindset is a bigger problem than the bad food or untrained staff. No tourist is out to tarnish your reputation‚Äîwe‚Äôre just sharing honest feedback based on what we experienced.\nGoa thrives on tourism, and bad experiences like this affect not just your business but also the overall reputation of the local hospitality industry. An average tourist spends ‚Çπ70,000 on their trip‚Äîif they leave with memories like this, it‚Äôs unlikely they‚Äôll return or recommend your place to others.\n\nIf you care about your shack‚Äôs future, you need to take feedback like this seriously. Improve your food quality, train your staff to actually listen to guests, and stop blaming your customers for pointing out the truth.\n\nDeflecting with responses or brushing off reviews won‚Äôt fix the very real issues with your service.",

So many flavours, textures, smells and everything tasted delicious.\n\nWashed down with an orange, pineapple and ginger juice and a watermelon juice, all for under 1800 INR while watching the sun setting.\n\nQuick friendly service too. You can't ask for more.",
