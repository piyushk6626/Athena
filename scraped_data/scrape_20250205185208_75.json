The food is not that great what we used to get earlier , maybe the chef has changed . The drink was ok, the service was quick and nice . Place is bit noisy as the tables are very close to each other. Sad to say being a Goan restaurant the traditional Goan bread poie was not available.margarita was never near a margarita cocktail .",

Lovely and cozy atmosphere, welcoming staff and as it is  Goa that too in South Goa chill vibes are in its DNA. Food was amazing, perfectly cooked. It's close to Bogmalo beach so you can just walk down to this joint. This place is a bit hidden in a small lane but Google maps will get you there. Price wise it was somewhere in the middle of Light on your wallet and Ripping your Wallet Apart...lol. Overall such good places are a rarity. Definitely deserves repeated visits.",
