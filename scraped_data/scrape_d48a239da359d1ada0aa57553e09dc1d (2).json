We went there for breakfast and dinner during our stay in hotel and the experience was really delightful! From the moment we stepped inside, we were greeted with warm smiles and a friendly atmosphere. The restaurant is spacious and comfortable, with plenty of room for families to relax and enjoy their meal.  It's definitely a great spot for families looking for a relaxed meal with high-quality food and great service. If you visited once you will always visit there for sure.",

The service was impressiveâ€”staff were attentive, friendly, and made sure we had everything we needed throughout the meal. The atmosphere was also lovely, creating a warm and inviting ambiance that enhanced our dining experience.\n\nHowever, the waiting time to get a seat was quite high, which was a bit disappointing. If they could manage the wait times better, it would make the experience even more enjoyable. Overall, a wonderful place to enjoy a great meal, but be prepared for a possible wait.",
