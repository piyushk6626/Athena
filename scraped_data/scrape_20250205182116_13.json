Cafe Bhosale was half shutter down so we went to this outlet of Navtara at around 10.25pm. My wife went to the loo. And we were seating to place the order but the waiter Ganesh was busy with the other customers. After some time Ganesh came to take the order, to start with we had ordered  paneer tikka masala and cheese stuffed garlic naan. But he said only plain naan is available as the bhatti is cold. Roti or chapati is available. Then we went to the cashier MR. NARESH WHO WAS VERY RUDE, MISLEADING AND OVERSMART on counter. Requested him to give managers contact number as we were disappointed with the service. The cashier said he doesn't have managers number. Then I saw the managers number on no smoking board, called him and explained him the entire scenario.\n\nIT WAS NOT ABOUT THE FOOD BUT ABOUT THE COMMUNICATION, BEHAVIOUR, HOSPITALITY TOWARDS THE CUSTOMER.\n\nNAVTARA HOTEL CHAINS THIS PORVORIM OUTLET IS THE WORST. WE HAD ALSO ENJOYED OUR MEAL IN THE OTHER OUTLETS WHICH WERE GOOD.\n\nTHIS OUTLET OF NAVTARA NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED IN THEIR SERVICE STAFF ESPECIALLY MR. NARESH WHO SEATS ON THE COUNTER.",
