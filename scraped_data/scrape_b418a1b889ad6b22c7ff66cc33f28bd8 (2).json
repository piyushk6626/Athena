Service is beyond excellent, waiters are very helpful and attentive. Food is extremely tasty. There’s three cute dogs as well. Had a great time. Thank you",

Apart from the standout food and drinks, their hospitality won our hearts. Mr Neville who is the owner recommended us food on his own according to our taste. The margarita is one of the best I have had. They have three friendly dogs who are super adorable. You will be lucky if you find Josh who will tell you all the perfect spots for the most instagramable pictures. Overall experience was super nice.",

Neville himself came and attended to each table and made sure that everyone was comfortable. The place itself gives a very relaxed vibe and faces a clean beach.\n\nWe went by Neville’s recommendations for food and were not disappointed. The food was fresh and delectable and the cocktails potent. What stood out for us was the hospitality, attention to detail and of course the amazing food that was served.\n\nThe dogs that belong to Pousada by the beach were also well looked after and amiable.\n\nThis is a must visit if you are looking for excellent service, good food and some serenity by the beach.",
