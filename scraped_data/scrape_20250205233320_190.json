The smell inside wasnt pleasant mostly because of the bad ventilation inside AC dining hall. Service was very good.\n\nFood was really good. They served good quantity as well. it was worth for the price paid. Hotel is mostly crowded, one of the reason is that this is a decent restaurant in the walkable distance from bus station.\n\nIts certainly a decent place but certainly not suggested if you are travelling with family including kids.",
