The food quality is impressive, and the courteous staff adds to the overall charm. We especially enjoyed the coastal seafood thali and vegetarian thali for lunch, both of which were excellent.",

The food here was absolutely delicious. Although the restaurant offers both vegetarian and non-vegetarian options, as a vegetarian, I truly appreciated their care and attentiveness in preparing veg dishes. Their service was impeccable‚Äîstaff members were very attentive, making sure customers were comfortable and satisfied with the taste and quality of the food.\n\nThe ambiance inside the restaurant was cozy and inviting, with a stylish dark theme and soothing music that set the perfect vibe for a relaxed meal. Another added convenience is its proximity to Madgaon Railway Station, making it a great stop for travelers.\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for a place in madgaon, goa with excellent food, great service, and a warm atmosphere, The Coastal Tawa is definitely worth a visit!",
