Had a beer, Grilled fish wrapped in banana leaf & Udon Noodles with steamed chicken. The grilled fish was so flavourful and aromatic. And the udon noodles were very satiating. The great ambience and the instrumental music is just cherry on top. Had a really good experience..\n9/10",

At first we did not know it was Thai or a restaurant I feel it‚Äôs a little hidden especially after dark.\n\nI‚Äôm honestly shocked by some reviews. üëÄ This place is just incredibleüç¥ ü§§ mouth watering food. They do a variety of foods, me personally I do not like to see a huge menu anywhere I go, cause the real question you have to ask yourself is, where are they storing all the food? Most food must be frozen. But this restaurant is actually also linked to a hotel.\n\nWe did not want a huge set meal. So we got a few starters as mains.\n‚Ä¢Shredded Fried Lamb\n‚Ä¢Chicken Skewers with peanut sauce.\n‚Ä¢Vietnamese vegetables spring rolls.\n‚Ä¢Pineapple chicken rice with cashew nuts.\nEverything was presented spectacularly.\nAnd everything tasted beautifully.\n\nThough it was quiet, the service here was exceptional. Our server poured our drinks, made sure everything was okay and checked back after a few minutes in to our meal. And because the restaurant has an outdoor under a canap√© setting our server gave us mosquito ü¶ü repellent which was a really gesture.\n\nThe music is so good. üé∂\nI found the restaurant had really soft lighting and had a pleasant, soothing ambience to it. The decor is so stylish also. You would literally sit there all night.\n\n10/10 for me\nAnd probably the nicest restaurant I‚Äôve been to in a while ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è I hope before I leave Goa I‚Äôll have the pleasure to eat in here again.",
