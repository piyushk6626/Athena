We did not try their food, but had coffee and muffin. The vanilla muffin was very soft and tasty. The hot chocolate was really great. The place has a chill vibe, to hang by.",

The staff was courteous and attentive, making check-in and other formalities seamless. The location was another highlight—convenient and close to local attractions.\n\nHowever, the dining experience left something to be desired. While the food quality was excellent, the preparation time was uncomfortably long. On multiple occasions, I had to wait well beyond the expected time for my meals, which was frustrating, especially during peak hours.\n\nIf the management can improve the efficiency of the kitchen service, it would significantly elevate the guest experience. Despite this issue, I would still recommend cafe d voyage e for its comfort, cleanliness, and overall hospitality.",
