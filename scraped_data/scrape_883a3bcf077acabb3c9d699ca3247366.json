Topped with fresh veggies and served with flavorful coconut chutney and tangy sambar, it’s a South Indian classic that never disappoints. Each bite is a burst of taste and comfort—truly a treat for the taste buds!",

Upon entering, the place felt unwelcoming, with disorganized seating and a general lack of cleanliness. Despite being half-empty, we waited far too long for someone to acknowledge us.\n\nOnce seated, things only got worse. The menu was limited, and many of the options were unavailable. After a long wait, the food arrived, and it was extremely underwhelming. My dish was bland and poorly cooked, with stale bread . My companion’s meal was equally bad, with soggy fries and poor smelling biryani.\n\nThe service was no better. The staff seemed uninterested, rarely checked on us, and were slow to respond when we needed something.\n\nOn top of the poor food and service, the atmosphere was unpleasant, with no adequate fans and an overall lack of comfort. It felt like the management just didn’t care about providing a good dining experience.\n\nFor the price we paid, the quality was abysmal. I won’t be returning to Ratnasagar, and I would advise others to avoid it as well.\nOne of the most pathetic place to eat,poor hygiene,dirty utensils, rude staff,stall food.\nOverall 01/10.",
