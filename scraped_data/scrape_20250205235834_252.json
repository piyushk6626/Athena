The hospitable husband wife duo runs the place and give all their visitors a warm homely experience.\n\nWe visited them twice during our 5 days Goa trip and had almost all their Seafood courses. Chonak in Honey Coriander sauce, Pomfret Rawa fry, Kignfish Thali, Chicken Xacuti and Crab Xacuti were few of our favourites and the refreshing Kokum Soda was cherry on top! The price range of all their dishes are also very reasonable.\n\nCan’t stop myself from visiting this restaurant over again. If you are seafood lover and looking for authentic Goan food experience, the Local Table is a must visit for you!",
