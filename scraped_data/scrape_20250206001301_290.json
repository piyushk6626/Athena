Toilet in poor shape.Owner states he will take up renovation this year to improve the things.Soon after eating food yesterday ,developed stomach upset ,which is still continuing after 24 hours . So naturally food hygiene was poor.",

The quality is not good of the food items. It came up while searching for pure veg restaurants, but I do not recommend it. Service is also not good, the staff should be trained.",
