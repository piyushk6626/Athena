Lucky was so attentive making suggestions we didn't know we needed. So glad we came here! Don't think twice just goooo. We got the Seafood platter bursting with flavours. Covered in breadcrumbs - perfect because I was craving crispy food :)\nDefinitely coming back for more!",

We had lunch and dinner at this place and I had vegetarian food here.  All the vegetarian food items were delicious and reasonably priced.  The veg fried rice was awesome and the traditional Goan veg thali was superb.  You get alcoholic drinks too and the owners serve the patrons with a smile.  Service is great but is a little delayed.",
