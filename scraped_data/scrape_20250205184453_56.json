If you are coffee lover like me then this is the place to be.\nOverall great food but what I find lacking was their attentive service. Place was pretty crowded for a weekend and I felt the staffs were a bit overwhelmed!",

The ambience of the whole restaurant is quite chill as there are usually not many people (or maybe I was lucky) and had hilarious posters plastered on every wall. Service was pretty good, and we got our food within 20 minutes. The food itself was quite heavy and I feel you would have to order only 2 dishes to feel full. First we got served the Omelette with chicken pieces infused which is actually quite ingenious and a hearty breakfast. The hot chocolate was quite average as I have had better but I like the fact that they serve it with Marshmallows. We then had the pain au Chocolat which oozed with chocolate and also was quite crunchy. Last was a vegan cheesecake I think which contained of a berry preserve which I felt just tasted like dense bread. Overall, I loved this place before and i still do now. I highly reccomend it.",
