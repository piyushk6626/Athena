Service was prompt, servers were earnest & the vibe was cool. There's parking for atleast 8 cars outside.\nWe had vegetarian Chinese. The Menu is limited for Indo Chinese section. We ordered Gobi Manchurian which they said Gobi was out of stock. The Honey crusted potatoes were hot & flavorful, as was the egg fried rice & Mushroom Chilly.\nOverall pleasant experience.",

In seafood their stuffed crabs and racheado mackerel is a must try!! My favourite has to be their Chicken Cafreal which has authentic taste 10/10.\nThey also offer a bar serving your favourite cocktails mocktails and drinks!!\n\nHere's what we tried üçΩÔ∏è\nKingfish thali 345/-\nStuffed crabs APS\nPrawns rava fry 375/-\nRacheado mackerel 315/-\nChicken Cafreal 315/-\nChicken biryani 355/-\nCaramel pudding 145/-\n\nThe ambience is well designed, classic and spacious.

The recheado masala however seem to be a bit overpowering but was tasty .\nPrawn curry was nice in taste but a little spicy .\nOverall a great experience with some real good food ..! Hoping to visit back soon  ..!",
