Also a music can add magical touch to the small place. Seats are less but nicely placed in such a tight space. Didn't get the logic behind why they need kitchen that big up there since they serve nothing but just salads. The boards on the wall are quite informative and the menu card is 10/10. I will recommend this place if you are really health conscious and don't mind spending few extra bucks to enjoy some really nice salads.",

And Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll fall for the salads hereðŸ¤¤\nVeg and non veg options are available and both are equally delicious! Also each salad here tastes different.\nLoved the ACE ( Arugula chicken egg) Its really an Ace!

They don't have much beverage options but the variety of salads covers up. It's not pure veg.  They add egg, chicken and alot more that fills up your stomach and also makes you crave for more.  The most healthy option. It's situated in panjim close to caculo mall, it's location makes it easily accessible to the office crowd as well as a hangout junction for the health obsessed college kids.",
