As a Goan, I tend to avoid spots with loud music and packed restaurants, but this place truly won my heart. From the moment I arrived, I was impressed by the calm and serene ambiance – a perfect setting to unwind and enjoy the sunset.\n\nThe staff was incredibly attentive, making sure we had everything we needed without being intrusive. The food was absolutely delicious ( Must try - Mezze platter , cafreal chicken tacos, Squids batter fry )– each dish was a delightful surprise, bursting with flavor and perfectly cooked. The cocktails were equally impressive, well-crafted and refreshing.\n\nIf you're someone who appreciates a quieter, more relaxed sundowner experience away from the typical tourist hustle, I highly recommend this place. It’s the perfect spot to enjoy a laid-back evening with great food, drinks, and an unbeatable view.\n\nTIP: Book via zomato and get 20% discount on billing.",

            "review_text": "We landed in Tereza Beach House by Sly Granny, hungry, grumpy and hot at 11.30 am. Chose  the place being a newly minted granny myself. We were surrounded by waiters who cared, who reached out to relieve our distressed selves.\nThings kept improving after that. The food was great the simplest of the dishes had that sly twist which made it special, strips of cornichon on calamari , the stuffed mushroom kulchas and everything else besides. Not only was the food fresh and delicious but we were advised to order less (which was absolutely the right advice for our group!). Didn’t mind changing the dish of pasta to make it spice free for my 18 month old granddaughter.\nKudos to the sly granny who went on to make a life and eateries after her son left. (That is the story behind the Sly Granny chain with 40 outlets in India )\nThe subtle humour that touched each aspect of the place won me to going to the place a second time in a place like Goa  where one is spoilt for choice.",
