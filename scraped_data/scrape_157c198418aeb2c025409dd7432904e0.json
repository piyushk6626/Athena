From the disadvantages I can list very bad (too strongly roasted coffee) and somewhat expensive prices. But I would like to visit this cafe again because of the desserts. They are to be recommended.",

I say this in a good way, cause they are genuinely interested to ensure that their guest have a good time and they have good knowledge about the food on the menu",
