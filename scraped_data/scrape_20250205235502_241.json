When I tried to share my thoughts, they couldn't have been less interested. So, here it is:\n\nI ordered the red sauce pasta, but there was nothing \"red\" about it. It was more like achaar pasta—with two slices of toast. When I asked where the sauce was hiding, the staff responded, \"This is what we serve.\" Well... after hearing that, there wasn't much left to say. It was a classic \"take it or leave it\" situation. So, we left it—right after paying 200+ for a dish that tasted like a pickle experiment gone wrong. Edible? Sure. Worth the price? Absolutely not. Did we accidentally order achaar pasta? Seems like it.\n\nNow, onto the shev puri. Remember that last bit of sukha puri you get after indulging in street-side pani puri? Yeah, that's pretty much what they served.\n\nAs for the Tandoori Soya Chaap... I won't say much because I'm not sure what it's supposed to taste like. It was edible, but it's definitely not making it to my reorder list.\n\nOverall: 2/5.",
