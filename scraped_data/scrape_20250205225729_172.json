The Quality of ingredients used, cooking techniques, flavours, textures, everything is so very well balanced. The service is great with stewards serving with a smile, and they do their job with passion. I would definitely recommend this restaurant. It's a must try place if you are in Porvorim.",

The Paneer Dry Fry was brilliant ;  could not add it to the recommended dishes as it didn't appear as an option, but definitely want to recommend it to veg and non veg people both!",

From the moment we walked in, the staff impressed us with their warm and humble demeanor, ensuring a seamless dining experience.\n\nWe started with the Spicy Kokum Cocktail, a creative and refreshing twist on classic flavors with a perfect balance of tang and spice. The food was equally impressive. The Fried Calamari was crispy, tender, and seasoned to perfectionâ€”a great way to kick off our meal. The standout dishes were the Mutton Osso Bucco, which was rich, hearty, and fall-off-the-bone tender, and the Prawn Gnocchi, a unique fusion dish that paired delicate, melt-in-your-mouth gnocchi with succulent prawns in a flavor-packed sauce.\n\nOverall, Lemon Chilli delivers on all fronts: excellent food, impeccable service, and a cozy ambiance. We will definitely be back to explore more of their menu. Highly recommended!",
