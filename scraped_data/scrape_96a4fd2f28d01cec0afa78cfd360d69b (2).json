To sum it up, the food presentation and the bill were more extravagant than the taste, with tiny portions that left us disappointed.\n\nI visited specifically to try food prepared by Chef Avinash Martins, but it didn’t live up to expectations. I’m not planning to visit again, and my friends share the same sentiment about this restaurant.\n\nThe images attached show a portion meant for 2 people, which cost over ₹5000 plus tax just for tasting the chef’s special, and it’s such a tiny portion. I understand that a chef’s tasting menu typically consists of small portions of various items to showcase their skills, as I’ve tried tasting menu at other restaurants to understand chef's skills and range. However, I was not satisfied here, with the portion size, taste, or overall experience here. Just sharing my honest review and personal experience.",

Personalised experience.\nI ordered Goan long island tea , which was beautiful to look at and simply awesome to taste.\nOrdered meat ball, galoti balls, mackerel dish everything, we ordered was explained to us, what it is and served in a very special way. Presentation was superb every time.\nEnded up having २ desserts one after another. first was bebinka with a twist of chocolate and caramel and second was Pal jaggery cheese cake which was again to die for.\nThe staff is well informed and very attentive. We were attended by Dhruv, whose suggestions were apt.\n\nOne of the best dining experience we had in Goa.\nCavatina, will visit soon.",
