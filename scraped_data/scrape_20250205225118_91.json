We saw the combo present on the menu later and the waiter refused to change it. Worst experience. Just wanted to grab more money from the customers.",

If you end up here and which I won't recommend, please check the menu before you order.\nMy experience: I asked whether he has an idly and wada combo - he answered no, I have to order separately. So I ordered. Later when I checked the menu it clearly said there were multiple combos but he wanted us to order separately so that he could earn that chiller!\n\nLater when we confronted the waiter he said it was our fault that we didn't check the menu!! We were like wow!! Dude are you serious??\n\nDon't ever visit this place!!",
