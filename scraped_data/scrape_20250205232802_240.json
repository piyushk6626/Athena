The restaurant is a part of the Crystal Goa Turquoise resort and is conveniently located a couple of steps from the beach. It offers privacy and comfort away from the hustke and bustle of Palolem. The staff is courteous and polite and the food high quality. Special shout-out to Sandipan for his attentiveness and being very receptive to all the guestâ€™s needs. Do look out for Pinky, the dog who is a permanent resident and will follow you to the beach. She absolutely transforms as soon as she gets near water. PS: She will also never say no to any good.\nLeaving this place with a smile. 5 stars.",
