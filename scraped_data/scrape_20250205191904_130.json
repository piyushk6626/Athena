All the waiters were amazing and around us to make sure we had everything we needed. Dominic made sure we were served well and was great throughout. Vijay also made sure I ate whatever I wished to eat because I visited Goa after a long time.\nChef Martin, loved the food you cooked. You deserve 5 stars.",

For desserts the sweet caramel custard and the nutty brownie complemented well with the meal. The atmosphere, service were good. Thanks to Suman who was the service person at the time we visited, so welcoming. Give it a try for goan fish curry if you wanna taste something new and awesome!",
