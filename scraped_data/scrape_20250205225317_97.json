They also had a separate beautiful candle light table right on the beach which you could book in advance for a romantic dinner. Excellent atmosphere right on the beach side.",

They take care of your each requirement.\n\nMy son is 4years and he was sleepy so they put a beach bed next to our table inside the shack so that my son can sleep peacefully.\n\nDelicious food specially Goan dishes are highly recommended. The beach area outside the shack is also calm and not much crowded.",
