We went here late at night hoping to find nothing but snacks surprisingly their whole menu was available, the service is fast and amazing. Food has an authentic Goan taste, I ordered a King Fish Thali which was more than enough for 1 person. I wasn't going to have anything to drink but the owner requested Me to try Urrak (local goan alcoholic drink available only during certain months in the year)  and it was amazingly made by the bartender, spicy yet cooling. Had an awesome dinner experience here.",
