The food is tasty, and the service is warm. place gets crowded sometimes other than that it's a very comfortable place with a lot of options on seafood. It's far from all the hassle of beaches and cities. However, it's a great escape, the one you should always opt for",

Our server Bandhan was very polite and attentive to our order requests. The fans and music being played sort of made it difficult to have a decent conversation without having to literally sort of shout. We ordered the usual beverages. Then started off with some french fries which would have been better had they been lightly salted, we did ask for Bandhan to get some salt. Squids batter fry which was fresh and tasty. Lepo rawa fry these were sort of over done making the fish sort of hard. Crab xec xec was really good and spicy with a decent amount of small crabs for the price. Lastly we had the modso fish thali\nwhich was the highlight of the meal. Fish nicely covered in rawa and fried properly. All in all a decent lunch outing",
