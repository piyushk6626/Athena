The restaurant has a cozy, relaxed ambiance that makes it a nice spot for a quiet dinner.\n\nI tried a couple of Thai dishes, and while they were pretty decent. The Grilled Prawns and Grilled Lamb Chops were my favourite. The Stir Fried Chicken is pretty good, too. For mains we got the Jungle Curry of Grilled Pork - and believe them when they tell you it's SPICY. Even though we asked for the spice to be toned down, avoid it if you cannot handle spice. The Red Curry on the other hand - while decent, didn't make the cut for me.\n\nThe presentation was lovely, and the dishes were enjoyable enough for a casual meal.\n\nThe service was friendly and attentive, which added to the experience. If you’re in the area and in the mood for some Thai-inspired food in a cozy setting, it’s worth stopping by.",

Jacob, my waiter, was excellent and recommended the jungle curry with grilled pork dish because I like spicy and it did not disappoint - maybe the best curry dish I’ve ever had. Definitely worth checking out when visiting Siolim.",

The ambiance was calming and aesthetically beautiful, offering a serene view of a small river and the Siolim Church. There is also an option to sit indoors, which adds to the versatility of the space.\nWe ordered the spring rolls, chicken golae, and a specially customized red curry with sea bass, which the chef graciously prepared for us. The curry turned out to be absolutely delicious, with beautifully balanced spices that elevated the dish.\nDespite a private event being hosted by the owner, they accommodated us due to Zomato's intervention, which we truly appreciated. Our server, Jacob, was exceptionally attentive and recommended some fantastic dishes tailored to our taste preferences.\nIf you're looking for an outstanding authentic Thai food experience in Goa with a soothing ambiance, Fireback Goa is a must-visit. Highly recommended!",
