Some pictures of the food have been shown. Their hummus and mayo, which we ordered, seemed to all be freshly made and taste very good. Could not fault the food. Would definitely go again.",

And at the Cafe Continga they have the best cakes available even if you arrive at 23:30 after your dinner time. I visit this place 5 years ago when I used to live in Anjuna, and yesterday I return for a dark chocolate cake and cappuccino. LOVE the place. Definitely coming back for more.",
