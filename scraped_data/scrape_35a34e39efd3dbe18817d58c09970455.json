A small place with a huge and diverse menu, run by a family who took care of everyone just like a good host would.\nThe kids had the Chicken loaded pizza which was overflowing with cheese, the tomato Bruschetta was just scrumptious with tiny pieces to fit entirely in your mouth, and a brilliantly marinated Chiken tikka made for mouth watering deliciousness, and to top it all of was Spaghetti, just chef's ðŸ˜˜",

All kinds of drinks are available too. Visited the place during my stay in Miramar every day. The restaurant owners are very warm and welcoming. Despite busy hours with many people coming in for dinner after the Film Bazaar event, they took their time out to recommend you food and drinks. There's no loud music so you can talk to friends and chill. On top of that the front pavement is nicely guarded by cute and friendly Dogs. Had a great experience. Will surely go back the next time.",
