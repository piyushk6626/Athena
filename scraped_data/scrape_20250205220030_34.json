Crab curry was awesome. Every dish served in the thali was wonderful. Prawn moilee as side dish for roti was wonderful combination. Goan Fizz was a great mocktail, I've not had such taste of cocounut milk and tender coconut water mix. Everything tasted home made without any masala and dishes are made with coconut milk. Overall worth visit and pocket friendly too",
