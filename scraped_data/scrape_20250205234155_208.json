If any veg guy tries it he‚Äôll start eating non veg. Also the service is quick and the quantity and quality are lovely. I‚Äôve already suggested this hotel to 5 of my friends who‚Äôre visiting Goa .\nThanks alot for the homely food üôèüôè",

Food was not hot except for fish fry and tawa  fish items.\nThis place is good if you want to try goan food and a low budget. The hygiene standards can be bettered.",
