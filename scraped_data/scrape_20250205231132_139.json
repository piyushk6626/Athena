We tried their pav with local bhaji, absolutely, absolutely delicious. Very very nice it was. Then we tried dal khichdi which was actually dal rice. Curd rice was good, but main attraction was the pav with local veg. You should go there for snacks kind of thing. They have got 2 sections, one is open and other one is with air conditioning",

We parked on the road side.\n\nKing fish thali was nice but very oily and side curries were all ok ok. But Pomfret thali was average. We even asked the guy to fry it again as it was not even fried well. The fish was tasteless even after frying. And he even charged 60 for extra rice which was free in some other restaurants. Overall I felt Itâ€™s average.",
