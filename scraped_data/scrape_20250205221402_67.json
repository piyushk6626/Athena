The upkeep and maintenance leave much to be desired; the condition of the restrooms, hand wash areas, and overall hygiene standards were notably lacking.\n\nThe restaurant is divided into separate vegetarian and non-vegetarian sections, but the vegetarian section is poorly designed. The air conditioning is insufficient for the space, making the central area uncomfortably warm.\n\nThe toilet in the non-veg section opens directly into the seating area and also there is an exposed hand wash station.\n\nThe seating arrangement is cramped, offering little to no privacy, which detracts from the dining experience.\n\nThe food itself was unremarkable, and the service was disappointing. There was no visible floor or restaurant manager overseeing the operations, which resulted in disorganized service and a lack of attention to detail.\n\nOverall, dining here was a letdown and did not live up to expectations.",
