Tried their King fish thali, with salads, kokum soup and the juiciest crab gravy Iâ€™ve ever tasted. If you want to enjoy a quiet authentic fish meal, you know where to go",

The hosts were really warm and hospitable, our bad luck that we couldn't try out their fish thalis as their freshly catched supply was done for the day.\n\nBut still we could try out their prawn curry, prawns masala and pomfret fry. The prawns curry and rice was to die for and the pomfret fry was the star of the table. The fish was pretty decent sized and it was truly value for money. I will recommend this place to people who don't like fancy food and want to try the humble yet delicious home cooked fresh seafood. Will surely visit this place again for their thalis and prawns rawa fry.",
