Nobody came to deliver and on every  call they said it's ready and will deliver soon.\nAt last i went to get order and go to see it was cooking and they made me wait for 5 mins. N finally i got uncooked prawns biryani which is tasteless.",

The idly was served cold and was average and so was the case with pav bhaji.\n\nSecond visit: The upma taste is inconsistent and this time they were using Courser rava. Come around 8 and you will get freshly prepared warm idly and Goan buns.",
