            "review_text": "Goan hut beach shack is a great place to  chill by the beach with good food and drinks. They have many sun loungers along the beach at the front of the cafe. Best to order some drinks and some food to use the sun loungers, otherwise there's a token fee of around 200 rupees for the use of them.\n\nDrinks are refreshing and there are many choices of them. From juices to sodas to mocktails, cocktails, beers and hare liquor. It's all here.\n\nSimilar for food, from pastas to Indian. It is all here also.\n\nTake a swim, drink, relax on the lounges, order some food... And repeat.\n\n....\nOn our subsequent visits, for dinner, the service was exceptional. The staff are very attentive, friendly, and warm. They are also very helpful in helping you feel comfortable in seating selection and deciding dishes from the extensive menu. We opted for the local Goan masala Prawn in full local spice level, cooked in the Tandoor.. It was not overtly hot though had a great punchy flavour that matched the delicate flavour of the prawns. The staff showed us the different prawns on offer and mentioned the price for each type.\nThe Goan calamari chilli was cooked to perfection. The calamari was Tender and  had a good mix of vegetables. Another standout dish was the watermelon and feta salad. The feta was home made and the saltiness made it very refreshing with the sweetness of the watermelon. Chapatti was light and soft.\nThere was no Goan Babinka available in this late evening as it was sold out, however we were assured that it would be made fresh in the morning and they asked us if we would be back to sample it. Of course!\n\nGoan Hut Beach Shack is a wonderful place to chill over a meal and savour the ocean view and experience.\n\nThere is also a good mix of Indian and other types of music to set the relaxing atmosphere.",
