Live cricket option also works well.\nBut when it came to food, it was not good.\nWe had ordered one dish veg pizza and that was totally under cooked. Literally, we could not chew it properly and the base was too hard even to cut.\nToppings were fine with cheese n veggies but we could not finish it at all. Lime soda was also okayish.\nWhen we asked them to recook the pizza again, they brought it after 10 mins when our hunger was done and still it didn't meet the expectations.",
