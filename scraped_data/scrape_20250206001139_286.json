Prices were the way how shacks mostly are priced here. One Little downside was excessive colors used in the Chinese items.\n\nStaff and service ⭐⭐⭐⭐\nPolite and very amicable staff. Were quick and positive.\n\nAmbience ⭐⭐⭐⭐\nNice music played all the time. Since this is a narrow beach, sea feels closer while sitting on the porch side.\n\nSeating\nUnder shade, Porch and on the beach tables.",

The staff is very cooperative, given the other places, where the service is just originated to dig money out of your pocket. Especially \"Anand\", who took care of us on our multiple visits with a very genuine smile. The view is good and very close to the entrance of the beach.",
