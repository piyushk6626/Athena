We ordered the grilled pomfret, and it was absolutely delicious – perfectly cooked and full of flavor. The staff were courteous and extremely helpful, guiding us through the menu and making thoughtful recommendations. We visited with an infant, and the atmosphere was warm and welcoming – our little one seemed to enjoy the place as much as we did. Overall, a wonderful experience with tasty food and fantastic service. Highly recommended!",

We particularly liked the butter chicken, butter garlic naan, garlic prawns..  The pasta was also very good when you are ready for a change of cuisine! Also very well accommodating for allergies. Thank you!",
