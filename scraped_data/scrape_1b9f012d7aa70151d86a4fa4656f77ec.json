            "review_text": "My visit to Kandeel Family Restaurant and Bar was, unfortunately, disappointing. Here‚Äôs an in-depth look at the experience:\nüç§ Prawns Rawa Fry\nAt ‚Çπ450, I expected a dish that justified the cost. What I got instead were small prawns with a flavor that was bland and unremarkable. The portion size and taste didn‚Äôt even come close to meeting expectations. Definitely not worth the price.\nü¶ë Butter Garlic Squid\nThe squid dish was slightly better but still far from impressive. The portion size was small, especially considering the price, and while the taste was acceptable, it wasn‚Äôt memorable. This is not a dish I would go back for.\n‚è≥ Service Speed\nThe biggest letdown was how unbearably long it took for the food to arrive. I understand that good food takes time, but this delay was excessive, and the results didn‚Äôt justify the wait. It felt like an eternity before the dishes arrived, which only added to the disappointment.\nüí∏ Value for Money\nSmall portions, average flavors, and sky-high prices make this place a poor choice for dining out. For the same amount of money, there are far better restaurants offering superior quality and faster service.\n‚≠ê Overall Verdict\nKandeel Family Restaurant and Bar fails to deliver on both taste and value. The long wait time, coupled with average food and steep prices, makes it hard to recommend. 1/5 stars at best. Look elsewhere for a better dining experience.",

It has got 3 floors where you can sit comfortably and enjoy your meal. Staff is also well disciplined. The blue vibe of the restaurant adds cherry on the cake. I am attaching photos for the referance. Kindly have a look. Enjoy eating....ü§é",
