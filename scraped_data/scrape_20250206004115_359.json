We had ordered chicken katsu rolls, red snapper grilled and spicy udon with black bean sauce. The fish was not fresh, we have eaten red snapper a lot n this one was tasting okish smelly a bit and not fresh. The noodles were not udon like but more like soba noodles. Otherwise the place is good, has a vibe. Just a disappointing experience this time. Also I felt like staff was not practicing hygiene as they are supposed to.",
