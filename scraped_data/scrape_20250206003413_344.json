Authentic taste with a twist of innovation especially in the drinks.\nVisited them twice and they haven't disappointed us yet ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€!\nBig cheers for bringing such great food to the table!! Kudos to creating the ambience in such a small space.\n\nPS: Finding parking is a bit tricky.\nBut you can always park a bit away and take a walk back after the dine-in and burn all those extra calories ðŸ˜œ.",

The staff was great very helpful. Very rarely you find the guy serving knows the menu so well. He actually knew what the food would taste and what goes in. I would definitely go back again.",
