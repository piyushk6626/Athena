The warm ambiance drew me in, and the food stole the show. The Classically Vegetarian pizza was a highlight, but the real magic happened with the Garlic Bread, Banoffie Pie, and Chocolate Hazelnut Cheesecake - each dessert was a masterclass! To wash it down, the Hazelnut Cold Coffee and Caramel Cappuccino were divine. If you're a foodie, do yourself a favor and get here ASAP! 5/5 stars",

I've been constantly scrolling and going through various restaurants for authentic wood fired pizzas and I end up seeing this place. The overall vibe of this place is really welcoming and warm, I had ordered for a diavola Pizza along with feta cheese and watermelon salad.\n\nThis was hands down the best Pizza I've ever had in my entire life, the crust was nice and soft. The ingredients were fresh and of top notch quality. The spiced chicken was nice and moist, the crust had a nice char to it, the marinara sauce was nice and a bit sweet too. I highly recommend this place to you for some really good and authentic wood fired pizzas.",

This charming spot is a rare gem in Goa, offering incredible food, exceptional service, and a cozy atmosphere that makes you feel right at home.\nWe tried their Pesto Classic Vegetarian Pizza, Funghi Pizza, and topped it all off with their Tiramisu, and everything was absolutely divine! The pizzas were perfectly baked with a crispy crust, fresh ingredients, and flavors that were simply unforgettable. The Tiramisu was the highlight—light, creamy, and hands down one of the best we’ve ever had.\n\nWhat really made our visit special was the outstanding customer service. A huge shoutout to Navin and Vishal, who went above and beyond to ensure we had a great dining experience. Their attention to detail and warm hospitality truly made us feel valued as customers.\nCafés like this are a rare find in Goa, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a unique and memorable culinary experience. Whether you’re a pizza lover or a dessert enthusiast, Café Sicily is a must-visit!\n\nWe can’t wait to return and explore more of their menu. Kudos to the team for setting such a high standard in food and service!",
