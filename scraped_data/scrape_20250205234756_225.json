Gulab jamun you should try it's good and lemon chicken was nice.The ambience is a bit disappointing as the roof in the first floor is really low and tough to walk as you might bang your head, I am around 5 feet 9 inch tall. The place is clean and tidy so you can have a quick bite here after getting down from the bus stand. Ample parking is there on the roadside and parking person will guide you.",

Even in this scorching noon also I can't hold myself to sprint through the whole thali.\nI had king fish thali nd buttermilk, which closed in 419 to be precise.\n\nPure value of money, highly recommend.",
