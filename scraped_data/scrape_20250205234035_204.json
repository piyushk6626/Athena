The food is super yummy. They have amazing fish fries which is undoubtedly fresh and prepared wither with their special masala or rawa fry. Our favourite was king fish.(updated Menu is attached). This place is opened from 11:00 am to 02:00 am at night. Takeaway option is also good as they pack the food really well. Their Chinese options are exceptionally tasty. Indian vegetarian and non vegetarian options are endless. We tried their dal which just felt like home. Chicken tikka masala was better than many other places in Goa. Very accommodating staff and owner. Do give it a try for a budget friendly,hygenic and tummy full meals. See you thereüòáüôèüèª",
