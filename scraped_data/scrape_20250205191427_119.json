And craft beer is also available. All the Lebanese food I tried really blew my mind-away. It was so so so delicious. A hidden gem in Goa. Must visit spot.",

The atmosphere was charm and welcoming, and the preparation of eggs & coffee was just the way to start the day.\n\nüç∞ It first got my attention when I saw they had Burnt Basque cake. Being Basque, I couldn't stop myself and had to try it. The cake was so yummy and smooth. It literally tasted like home.\n\n‚òïÔ∏è coffees are a bliss. From the tiramisu coffee to the regular cold coffee, both options tasted intense and creamy at the same time.\n\nüç≥ Lebanese eggs were the change-maker. I was afraid to try as there's a chilli on the menu stating that might be spicy but it was SO not spicy. Just the way I like it. I ordered twice in different days, and if I was still in Goa, I would have definitely started my day there.\n\nüë•Ô∏è Staff were welcoming and professional.  They made sure you were comfortable without being intrusive. I recommend this place 100% to anyone visiting Goa. Even though you are not in a nearby area, try to make some time to visit if you are a foodie!",

The vibe is pretty laid back at this place and some nice jazz really adds to that. I like the platter that they serve which is like a no brainer every-time i visit, and the coffee is also just perfect roast for my liking. We do give it a try to new dishes from their menu, sometimes it works out some times it doesn‚Äôt, like it didn‚Äôt work when I order ful mudammas. The pastry section has wide variety, tiramisu was decadent although bit pricey for the portion. On my suggestion, do give a try to muhammara which is rated as best dips in the world and kefi does it nicely.",
