Being a female was denied like it's so sad, you come to South Goa they won't deny you at any restaurant or shops if you state that you are in an emergency. Like dude I won't rob your hand wash.",

The service was quick the fish thali highlight was the bangda fish so was served at that rate. Whereas the prawn's golden fry was nice well cooked but the coating just dropped off. The chicken vindaloo was too spicy maybe that's what it's supposed to be. Cheese garlic Nan hardly hard any cheese. Overall can drop in if you are on a hurry and can't spot anything around.",
