            "review_text": "Our usual Saturday night dining with friends took us to this place due to good reviews and images of food on social media...but oh boy...we were thoroughly dissapointed.\n\nThe place looks charming at first from outside.\n\nWe ordered many dishes after taking recomendation from our server.\n\nThe food is something we will not be going there for second time. Below mediocre ..no taste...mostly things dumped in spices and cooked ..\n\nFor starters.. we had french fries( good item on the menu.. seriously)...cheese garlic naan which was standard and butter garlic squids which carried hint of fishiness ..\n\nWe then ordered chicken basil which was only  4 star item on the menu.\n\nThe orrad kebab( or whatever was it's name) was lacking taste..just spiciness and raw spice taste overwhelming you.\n\nWe patiently waited for green masala stuffed bangde( mackerels)..our bar was very high as we have had delicious bharille bangde in another restaurant in Panaji.Sadly these bangdes we fried rechado style( without rava) and the green masala inside was lackluster..the bangdes were fresh though.\n\nThen some tawa fried chicken which was very spicy.( Disappointing)\n\nVegetarian options were less . The paneer dish was sub standard and the mushroom tikka was thumbs down.not at all cooked properly..the veg biryani was too spicy with whole spices spoiling every spoon of the dish.\n\nThe egg fried rice was surprisingly good compared to the dissapointing things we had ordered earlier.\n\nThe drinks- kokum soda and lime soda were okayish and lit was substandard.\n\nWe skipped desserts as options were few and we did not want to spoil the mast meal of the day so we went to another place.\n\nThe place looks good from outside but needs some renovation where there are water seepages on the walls and specially in the washroom area.\n\nRequest to the owner to please change your chef/ cook .\n\nThe serving staff were quick but they need a little polishing and better uniforms .\n\nWe will not be going there again.",

But what makes this place really standout is itâ€™s interiors. The bright walls with a mix of modern and and a few hints of heritage decor make this restaurant truly Instagrammable. Personally we were a fan of everything we ordered from cheese balls and kebabs to chicken gravy and noodles. Even the desserts are on point. We definitely recommend visiting this joint.",

The new place has got pretty interiors.",
