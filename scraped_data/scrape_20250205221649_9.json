The juice was super refreshing, a perfect addition to the meal. I went there for brunch, and the vibes were just incredible. The combination of trance music and great food made the experience so enjoyable. The ambiance is cozy and laid-back, surrounded by greenery, making it a great spot to relax and unwind. Itâ€™s definitely a place Iâ€™d recommend for a chilled-out brunch in Goa!",
