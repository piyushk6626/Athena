The order comes astonishingly fast. The paneer is really good considering the price point. The tandoor rotis are soft and delicious. It's a vegetarian's paradise. Opens at 630am and closes at around 1030pm. Open for breakfast, lunch evening snacks and dinner.",

The quantity is acceptable but not the quality. It was very rich with not properly cooked powder spices which will be a torture for your taste buds as well as digestive system.\n\nIt's an absolutely veg dining restaurant. Seating capacity is very good and the place is well crowded during eating hours. The service was fast. Price of the food was also pocket friendly. As usually the location is also very good but without proper parking place.\n\nThis time Google reviews and ratings fooled me. As per my recommendation, this place may be avoided as far better multiple options for veg restaurants available nearby.",
