But we got a bit saucy in all.\nI ordered orange honey pork steak, barbecue prawns, mixed seafood sizzler (yea,i made a mistake, all came with honey and sauce).\n\nWe got scammed this time, lol ðŸ˜†.\n\nBut Chicken chilly fry was yummy (it was dry).\nAnd lime soda was good.\n\nBest time to visit 7pm to 10pm.",

I don't know how relevant this is but I'll mention it here.\nWe had 4 things and none of them met my expection. The chicken chilly fry was the only 'ok' one, the prawns barbeque was just about fine but the prawns themselves were good but they aredrowned in a sweet garlicky sauce( could have mentioned it somewhere on the menu, or maybe ask the waiter to mention it to the customer?), next up was the seafood sizzler, which to no suprise was also sweet!! The seafoody flavour just was not there and we had one among us who had their sizzler before and even she was surprised at how bad this was.\nAnd finally the most disappointing one, the orange honey steak pork. It was drowned in the same sweet sauce as the prawns,( so just recycling the same sauce for every dish i guess??If i wanted something this sweet  I would've gone to an ice cream store. It was also on the firmer side, not what you usually expect from pork.\nThe waiter seemed cold, but then again they might've been rushing since it was near closing time.\nTo sum it up, had high expectations going by reviews and even suggestions from friends but had to leave feeling extremely disappointed!",
