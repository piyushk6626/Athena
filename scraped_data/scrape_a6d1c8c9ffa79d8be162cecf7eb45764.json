We visited this place for 2 days and tried various food and coffee ‚òï it was really amazing ü§©, we tried Burger üçî, Spaghetti üçù, Chicken Pesto and Veg Pesto Sandwich ü•™. In coffee we tried Vietnamese, Cold coffee, Cappuccino etc. and nothing disappoints us.\n\nThe staff üßë‚Äçüíº are active and really helpful. The Cafe is on the ground floor and the first floor as well. They have the in-house parking üÖøÔ∏è facility. You need not to find it much as it's on the main road itself. We also bought a coffee ‚òï packet from here as it was reasonable. The vibe is really good here üôÇ, it's very calm and positive. This is something which you need in the morning üåÑ at the start of your day.",

From the moment I walked in, the positive vibe of the cafe made it a welcoming start to the day.\nThe breakfast was one of the best I've had. We ordered the Eggs Benedict with Pork Ham, the Pesto Chicken Sandwich, and the Turkish Eggs. The Turkish Eggs were particularly outstanding‚Äîtruly a solid 5/5. Each dish was prepared with great care and tasted fantastic.\nTheir coffees are equally impressive. I couldn't resist having two cups and tried the Coffee Latte, Cappuccino and American Espresso. Each cup was brewed to perfection and really complemented the meal.\nThe quality and taste of every bite justified every penny spent.\nThe staff were incredibly kind and attentive, adding to the overall positive experience.\nOne of the sweetest touches was when I took a parcel home. They included a handwritten note on the inside, which was a lovely gesture.\nThis cafe is a gem, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for top-notch food and coffee. I‚Äôll definitely be visiting again!",

I had the best cold coffee here; it was absolutely amazing. The crispy French toast was unique and delicious, a refreshing twist on the classic. We also tried the cappuccino, omelette, and hash browns‚Äîeverything was super tasty.\n\nThe atmosphere is inviting and calm, making it the perfect spot to relax. The service was excellent, and they even have ample parking space, which is a big plus. While the prices are on the higher side, the quality and experience make it worth it.\nOverall, a wonderful caf√© and definitely worth a visit!",
