I decided to dine in, and unfortunately, the service was slow — my order of 2 croquettes and 2 beef chops took over an hour to prepare. When the food finally arrived, the beef chops were stale and cold, not at all what I had come to expect.\n\nI don’t want to damage the reputation of your brand, but I think it’s important to be honest and share my experience. Hopefully, this can help improve the service for future customers.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.",

            "review_text": "Another cozy place located in the internal part of the outskirts of Panjim in Odlem bhaat Taleigao. Probably one amongst the few rare remaining places dishing up some traditional Goan Portuguese food in and around the Panjim city limits, it may feel a little heavier on the pockets for those who prefer the gaado style cutlet paos etc, but the coziness and ambience is worth that little extra premium. And ofcourse the food too is right up there like the good old glory days.",
