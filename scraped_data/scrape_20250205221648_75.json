This historic Goan restaurant, established in 1968, boasts an antique and posh ambiance, hinting at its storied past (which includes the infamous arrest of Charles Sobhraj!).\n\nWe began with some mocktails, which were decent but not particularly memorable.  The star of the show, as per their reputation, was supposed to be the Chicken Cafreal. While it wasn't the best rendition I've had, it was still enjoyable.  However, the true delight of the meal was the Mutton Sukha.  This dish was bursting with flavor and cooked to perfection.  The Chicken Steak, on the other hand, was a bit ordinary.\n\nThe saving grace of the meal was the knowledgeable staff. Their recommendations were spot-on, and they were attentive throughout the service.\n\nBe prepared for a slightly steeper price tag compared to other Goan restaurants. Parking is plentiful, but keep in mind that this place tends to get crowded, so arriving early is recommended.",
