However, the sizzler portion was not enough and left me wanting more. On the bright side, the watermelon juice was refreshing and perfectly balanced.\n\nThe ambience and decor deserve a special mention – they were exceptional and added a lot to the dining experience. The pricing was decent, making it an affordable spot for a good meal.\n\nIn conclusion, it’s a place worth visiting, especially for the great atmosphere and reasonable prices. Just make sure to order enough if you're craving sizzlers!",

The Special Goan Thali felt authentic. They didn't have crabs available so they were ready to swap it with prawns or King fish in the Thali.\n\nVeg menu items were also delicious and the quantity was good. Spent nearly 400-500 PP excl. drinks.",
