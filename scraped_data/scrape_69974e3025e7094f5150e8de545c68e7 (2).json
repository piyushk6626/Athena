The appeal of this establishment not only in its delectable cuisine but also in its picturesque seaside setting. While savouring our meal, we were captivated by the breathtaking sight of the azure sky blending with the ocean. As regular patrons of Souza Lobo since 2016, we can attest to its consistently excellent food and ambience. Despite the relatively high prices, it is a worthwhile indulgence, particularly for an early lunch or brunch during your time in North Goa.",

            "review_text": "Souza Lobo is located on Calangute Beach and it is best to walk from the main road or hotel to this place.\n\nThere are many seating options available, within the main restaurant building or outdoors towards the beach. There are many various size tables to suit singles, couples and large groups.\n\nAs with many restaurants in Goa, there are 2 menus - a food menu and a drinks menu. Both of which have a large selection of offerings. The staff will also show you some local catch of the day seafood.\n\nBoth drink and food options are of good quality and the restaurant is on the mid level pricing. The Goan fish curry with kingfish is of good flavour. I did ask for the full local spice level. Complementing this curry was fluffy rice and a butter chapatti that was soft and wonderful. The cucumber raita is refreshing and cleanses the palate when combined with the Goan fish curry.\n\nThe babimca dessert tasted amazing though the presentation was a little lacking and didn't match the presentation that was on the menu. It was a little sloppy in presentation.\n\nDrinks were good with the papaya shake being of medium consistently and with a good amount of papaya flavour.\nCocktails were good also.\n\nOn this occasion the service was generally good though a little slow.",
