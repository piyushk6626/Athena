You're best booking in advance to avoid disappointment as the place is popular or eat early.  The food was delicious. I had calamari masala fry for starters which wasn't too hot and a chicken from the tandoor which was amazing. Service is great as well and they do fantastic cocktails. The manager is a very happy, friendly guy and the waiters are quick and attentive.",

I had the red snapper fillet with potato cake and parsley sauce 4 times (might have been 5 times ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è). Other dishes of note are the chicken tikka and Bombay potatoes, lemon chicken (specials board), fillet steaks and the Surf and Turf in an amazing butter sauce üòã. Sam (the restaurant and bike owner) and his team are friendly, professional and very attentive. Our thanks go to Surender, our waiter, for taking care of us with such consideration...... absolutely excellent!! Well done to the whole team, you deserve the reputation you've gained.",
