It's a 4 course dinner with live faado (traditional Portuguese music) performances. Wow! What about experience. Really too wonderful. We didn't know what to expect when we booked...but from the first note of faado, we were just blown! Will cherish the experience for a long time.\n\nThe food was delicious. Veg was good. The non veg was really memorable.\n\nThe ambience was just wow! The interiors of alfama are just lovely. Overall a truly wonderful night in Goa.",
