I don't know how the owner can do this to its already depreciating business. So we went for Chinese instead. Ordered Manchow soup, Schezwan fried rice and semi gravy chilly chicken. When asked the waiter about suggestions, he asked me to check menuðŸ¥º. Food quality ordinary, chilly chicken was sweet, I mean how??? Was expecting better from a popular hotel chain of Goa. Especially when you are commanding prices which are on the higher side.\nMy experience was synonymous with their dwindling business in the Vasco unit",

The sheets didnâ€™t look clean and washed. A big burly man at the desk had absolutely no courtesy to get things fixed and addressed issues with a -so what- attitude. The restaurant next door served us oily sabjis and half cooked rice, no improvement despite complaints. Donâ€™t lose your money on this!!",
