Coffee enthusiasts will appreciate the quality of their brews, and the thick milkshakes are equally delightful. Baked goods such as sourdough and country loaves are made in-house and have garnered a loyal following. Regular patrons also look forward to treats like dark chocolate cranberry cookies, cinnamon buns, and chocolate almond banana muffins. The Basque cheesecake is particularly noteworthy.",

Being from England we thought that this was an odd combination but it works beautifully and tastes amazing.\n2 days later on our return journey I opted for something different...a cheese mushroom and spinach omlette. Cooked and prepared to perfection with amazing flavours.\nWe both ordered the thick salted caramel shake...ummmmm yummy.\nPlease visit this amazing place you will not be disappointed.\nWe cant wait to come back next year.\nA fantastic ambience with great music playing in the background.\nStaff friendly and very helpful.",

The semi-open space offers plenty of room to park and walk around, adding to the overall comfortable vibe.\n\nFood we tried:-\n• Eggs Benedict: Absolutely fantastic, served with spinach and mushrooms. The eggs were incredibly fresh, and the poaching was done to perfection. I loved it.\n• Double Smash Cheeseburger: Delicious and highly recommended if you’re craving a classic burger.\n• Mushroom Cheddar Toastie: Perfectly crispy and well-toasted; truly delightful.\n• Eggplant Schnitzel: My friend ordered this and thoroughly enjoyed it, flavorful and well-prepared.\n• Chicken tatos with pineapple Salsa: Kinda off soft taco, made from roti. Taste is good and salsa is refreshing.\n• Iced Americano: Paired perfectly with our meal, providing a refreshing kick.\n• Caramel salted shake: Perfect drink as a dessert, home style and taste.\n\nOverall, it's a great place for a lazy Sunday brunch, offering both excellent food and a welcoming ambiance.",
