            "review_text": "At Tomatoes Beachside Resort, the dining experience is elevated with a delightful mix of Continental and North Indian cuisine. Guests can savor authentic North Indian dishes, rich in flavor, alongside a selection of popular Continental fare. From creamy curries and tandoori specialties to pasta, steaks, and fresh salads, the resort’s menu promises a taste for every palate. Complementing the food is an impressive variety of beverages, perfect for pairing with your meal. The best part? The full beach view. While you enjoy the cool sea breeze and gaze at the serene waters, you can indulge in these culinary delights. However, it’s worth noting that the prices are relatively high compared to similar beachside spots, which may catch visitors off-guard. Despite this, the overall experience, with its scenic beauty and flavorful offerings, remains memorable for those seeking both relaxation and a taste of the coast.",

I just loved the vibe of this place what I didn’t like is bit of their server attitude and some food options. I guess this experience can happen with me only, but I just found that they didn’t had much options in authentic and food like they have chilli prawns and they taste like chilli chicken, so it was a taste was same. The main thing was different chicken to prawns what I found very common in our city kiss, we can found them easily to me if I am in Goa. I want to eat so I want their food. I guess I could be wrong, but that’s my opinion. And this is not about only this cafe. This is about all the cafes are opening and all are opened. I really want them to add some go and taste. It’s not about fish, prawns and crab. It’s bit about taste and I guess Goa is missing their flavours.\nOverall, this was nice\nYou should visit …",

The ambiance is laid-back, with a beautiful view of the sea, making it perfect for unwinding. The food is delicious, especially the vegetarian options, and the service is friendly and attentive. It's a lovely place to enjoy a casual, tasty meal while soaking in the beach vibes. Highly recommended!",
