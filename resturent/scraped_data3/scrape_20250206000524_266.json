The chef is Thai and the food has the authentic flavour that so many restaurants fail to reproduce. Everything I tried here was delicious and filling. I even ordered extra food because I wasn’t sure when I would be able to visit again. That’s how tasty it was. Delicious!",

            "review_text": "Food here was absolutely delicious!! I had two starters....spring rolls with sweet chilli sauce and Tom Kha soup with prawns.  The prawns were lovely and soft and the soup was loaded with other vegetables such as cauliflower, mushrooms and a few sliced carrots.  The flavours were enhanced with the usual Thai basil leaves and other traditional Thai spices and lemongrass.\n\nFor main I had green curry with chicken and again the flavours were spot on and it too had loads of vegetables....broccoli, green beans, chunks of egg plant.  I asked for coconut rice but they couldn't do that so had plain rice instead.\n\nI also asked for a mango sticky rice to take away but was told this was unavailable.  When I asked why, I was told as it was not mange season and so they only use fresh mango rather than the ones you can get now.\n\nTo drink I had the lemon iced tea and whole bill was just under 1,800R",
