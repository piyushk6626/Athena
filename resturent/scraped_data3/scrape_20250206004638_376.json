Love this shack as the people who work here are great. Dennis the shack owner, is kind and funny and very friendly. Chewa (pronounced c1) the waiter, started working whilst we were there. He is a fabulous person who made us feel special and welcome everyday. The whole team are great. Food is delicious and they have a Tandoor. Highly recommend anything cooked in that. Lots of Brits in this shack, who all seem to be relaxed and friendly too. Great place to celebrate üçæ a birthday too as they organise music, cake, banners etc.. for special occasions. It is easy to arrive in the morning and not leave until late at night. Drinks are good. Wine is reasonable and in decent sized glasses too. Rocky will even give you a complimentary lift home in the evening in the shacks jeep. Don't miss this shack and look out for the really great waiter  ... Chewa.",
