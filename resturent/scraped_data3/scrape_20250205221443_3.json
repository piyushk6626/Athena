They even have a separate area for families with kids, which is great. I really enjoyed the ambiance and the service was excellent. It can be a bit pricey for couples, but if it's just a girls' outing, it’s more manageable since the cover charge can be used towards food and drinks. Their cocktails are delicious too! Overall, a fantastic experience and definitely worth checking out!",

Id imagine that this is the perfect spot for watching the sunset.\n\nWe just ordered a coconut and some coffee, so I can't say anything about the food or cocktails, however, I think it's very easy to spend a lot of money here based on the prices of things. They also charge two different service fees, which is not indicated on the menu, so the prices are not reflected accurately, which is the main reason for the loss of one star.",

Upon entering, guests are greeted by a chic, modern decor that seamlessly combines elegance with a laid-back vibe. Purple Martini is an ideal choice for both casual gatherings and special occasions.\n\nThe bartenders are knowledgeable and attentive, eager to offer recommendations and tailor drinks to individual preferences. The menu also boasts a selection of complementary small plates, each thoughtfully designed to enhance the drinking experience. From savory bites to sweet treats, the food pairs beautifully with the signature cocktails. Overall, Purple Martini is not just a bar but a vibrant social hub, perfect for anyone looking to spent his evening. It would be great if the prices of the dishes in the menu can be bought down. You get a simple Maggi for 275 and an Oreo shake for Rs. 500.",
