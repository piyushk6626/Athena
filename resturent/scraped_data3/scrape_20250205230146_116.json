Cocktail- Soulkadi and whiskey 100 pipers. Everything we ordered was simply great tasty and delicious.  Would recommend highly to visit this place. Simply the atmosphere is great, situated in farm with all authentic vibes. Just what I was searching for!!! Price for drinks and food was budget friendly. We visited Goa for 5 times in a single Year but never found such relaxing place.",
