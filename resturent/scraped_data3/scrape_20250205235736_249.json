The food, the ambience, everything about this place is outstanding. Had breakfast and dinner. The beef green curry was really good. The food does take some time but it's well worth it. Francis the gentleman who runs the place is a wonderful person too. The rice when u order is good for two so please ask for half portions if you don't want to waste food.",
