Staff named shravani had no manners and was just making faces and was so irritated while taking the order. They really need to work on thier service. Or itâ€™s not gonna be long that this outlet is gonna shut Tables are all dirty and customers have no place to sit. And the staff is least bothered to clean the tables and busy on the phones",
