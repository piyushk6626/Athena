Compare to the other beaches we went to in North Goa, this beach shack felt the most comfortable and secure. Gitu was really attentive but not in an annoying way, he just knew when we needed him, got rid of the sellers when it was getting too much and just left us relax and enjoy our time there. Spotty is really lucky to have him. If you fancy break from spicy food, I personally recommend any of the \"sizzle\" dish from the menu! Thank you Spotty & Gitu you made our time there really memorable.",
