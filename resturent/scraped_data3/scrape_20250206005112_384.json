We had to wait around 40 minutes for our food to arrive.\nAnd this was at a time when the place is hardly even with any customers.\nThe quantity of the food could've been better. The taste is great. The wait time is absolutely horrible.",

While the presentation was classy, the chicken pieces were awful. There were tough cartilage pieces which we kept spitting out every other bite. When we raised this with the waiter who was blank right from the start, he called a chef out who came and dug in between the pieces and said there were just 2 to 3 such bad pieces which was by accident. Can't beat this feedback from the cook! When we asked them to look into it, they spent 15 minutes and did nothing about it and the dish was still sitting in their kitchen. We called for the bill and paid for it anyways. While exiting we decided to just have a word with the owner/ person incharge at the counter, he said he was aware of the dish being returned and countered our feedback with \"we only buy boneless chicken\". I told him I don't want anything in return but wanted to share feedback as a customer,  he gave a sly smile in return. That pretty much sums things up from - Delayed service, rude staff and unpleasant food. Best to not fall for the reasonable pricing and visit a better place..",
