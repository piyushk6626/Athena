            "review_text": "My partner and I were staying at the Hyatt here and we took the “cook with the chefs” class. We highly recommend it!! You get to pick one chaat, one main, and one dessert, and they prep the ingredients for you and then walk you through making the recipe. We did the chulha signature palak patte ki chaat, Goan style chicken chili fry and pistachio gulab jamun. The food was fresh and DELICIOUS and the chefs were very attentive and kind, we asked a bunch of questions and they answered everything. The price was also very reasonable.\nWe dined there for our last night and ordered a lot of small dishes, which were all fantastic. The chicken and fish are packed with flavor, very good even for an Indian palette. The cocktails are a little more hit or miss, but there are definitely some gems on their menu, which they rotate out regularly. The orange margarita was our favorite, great spices and tanginess from the tamarind sauce.\nYou HAVE to try their palak patte ki chaat!\nThey threw in a jalebi for dessert, which comes with a creamy custard and the combo is to die for. I don’t really think you can go wrong!",

Definitely not recommended!!",
