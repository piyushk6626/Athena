This place has got it all - good vibes, great music, and adorable decor.\n\nWhat I love most about Dera is that it stays open until early morning, making it the perfect spot to hang out with friends in Anjuna. The ambiance is lively and energetic, with fantastic music that you can vibe with and dance to all night long.\n\nBut what truly sets Dera apart is its OUT-OF-THE-WORLD food! I've tried a variety of dishes, and each one has been great.  And the best part? It's incredibly affordable!\n\nThe staff at Dera are super polite, hospitable, and always ready to help.\n\nIf you're in Anjuna, do NOT miss out on Dera Bar and Restaurant! It's a hidden gem that'll become your favorite spot in no time.",
