I tried almost every curry/dal and loved it all.\nFriendly staff who were very kind and helpful with the menu, and even offered recipe insights.\nI would recommend any curry and as many chapatis as you can manage.\n\nUnsure if the restaurant has changed location, see picture of the one we went to.",
