I tried the palak paneer here which I would like to highly recommend to the vegetarian lovers. The palak panner was creamy and melting over the taste buds. The veg starter brinjal rawa fry was crispy, spicy and tasty. Another recipe which I would definitely like to recommend is the chicken crumps- a Unique recipe served with mayo. I also tried the chanak thali which was average. The chanak rawa fry in the thali was fresh and fried well However the rice and curry were served cold. This is a local place and kindly note there is no AC here. The service is good and the waiters are well trained. The place is very much inside from the main road but google solves the way out. This place is very affordable and reasonable in cost and provides good quality food.\n\n· Trip type: Friends\n\n· Service: 3.5\n\n· Location: 3.0\n\n· Hotel highlights: Crowder so one should try to be early especially during lunch time·\n\n· Walkability: No walking distance; its Just on the road with street parking service.\n\n· Food & drinks: The food tastes good. We all enjoyed the chicken crumps and palak panner the most.",
