In opposite direction of the restaurant, you find another restaurant that has live show and luxury interior but the food was worst than here. I recommend you try local Goan food here! You wonâ€™t disappoint.",

This trio works together to serve fresh, home cooked food to everyone. Their Moto \"Eat Well...Live Well\" is a perfect example of how we locals cherish our staple food here in Goa.\n\nPravin is an absolute example to his generation. He has completed his course in hotel management and also had been offered a good job at a reputed 5 star hotel in Panjim but instead he chose self employment and along with his Mom and Sister started this beautiful restaurant.\n\nWe loved each and every dish we ordered and the weather was a cherry on top of the cake.\n\nRates ( very reasonable and budget friendly)\nFish Thali Lepo -  150/-\nRawa fried Prawns - 300/- for 10 good size pieces.\nKingfish Thali - 250/-\nBangda Thali - 130/-\nModso Thali - 200/-\nReshad Masala Bangda - 100/-\nGoan Chicken Xacuti - 200/-\nVeg Thali - 100/-\nPhulkas (must order)\n\nTimings - From 9:00 am to 9:00 pm\n\nVisit this place for awesome home style meals and a lot more.\n\nWatch the full vlog:\nhttps://youtu.be/06d-lRchSVg?feature=shared\n\n#fishthali #bestfishthali #homecookedthali #panaji #fishthaliinpanaji\n#goa #besttimetovisitgoa #rainsingoa #fishfry #family #bestrestaurant #goasbestrestaurant #campal #kalaacademy #fishcurry #bestfishthaliingoa #fishthaliingoa #ashsayzso",

The rice was damn cold and every item was not fresh Very bad bland vibes. The worst thali I have ever eaten. Why couldn't they serve it with warmth and care? The waiter is on mobile phone, the owner doesn't care. Very sad. Came with so many hopes reading reviews but will not come back again.",
