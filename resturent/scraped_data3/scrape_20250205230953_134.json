The owners were very welcoming to our dog, and went out of their way to make him comfortable, be it the table we sat at, water, or even goodies for him.\n\nThe food, is definitely better than what we usually refer to as Italian. The bread was prepared well, the ingredients were fresh, and tastes were well balanced.\n\nThe prices however are crazy. A dish of 4 tiny bruschettas for 440 felt quite overpriced. The table cloths and surroundings could use a bit of improvement and clean up. A bit of help in ordering would be nice (it is assumed that diners already are well versed with ‘actual’ Italian verbiage).\n\nThey don’t serve alcohol, but are kind enough to let you get your own, if u want.",

Charming cozy little restaurant easily hidden from the main road offers one of the best Italian food in goa. Run by the charming Mr Davide and his partner who makes his guests comfortable and single handedly manages the guests and serves everyone with a big smile.\n\nLoved everything we ordered especially the salmon pizza and the coffee cheesecake with salted caramel dressing. The pizza crust is just perfectly made and the toppings are great and made of good quality ingredients.\n\nRecommend this place for anyone looking for authentic Italian food only.",
