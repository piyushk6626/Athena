While the menu has a variety of options, some dishes fall short in terms of flavor and presentation.\n\nWhat truly stands out here is the incredible staff. The team is exceptionally friendly, attentive, and always eager to make your visit comfortable. Their warm hospitality and excellent service create a welcoming atmosphere that makes you want to return.\n\nIf you’re in Candolim and value great service, Friends Bar and Restaurant is worth a visit. The staff's dedication ensures a pleasant experience, even if the food isn’t the highlight.",
