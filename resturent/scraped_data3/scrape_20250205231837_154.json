You should definitely try this restaurant . Do try their king fish rava fry and prawns/fish thali .\nThe only problem is the wait time to get the food. It took more than 45 minutes to get the food. It wasnâ€™t crowded on the day visited.",

Not cleaned properly,  the taste was just ok nothing great about it, the table was dusty, the service is not at all good, the place was totally empty, the prices are not mentioned in the menu, it's a big red flag, they make you order an expensive item first by saying that the cheaper one is out of stock and then tell that the cheaper one is available just one portion if we want, but the expensive one is also already in making process so we can buy both. The prices are told depending on your looks and spending capacity.  Please don't visit here, check something else, where you will see lots of good and decent crowd.",

They seem to be short of staff but service was fine. Within budget menu. Overall a good place n recommended.",
