It's not as per the quality of food you get in the Kailash Parbat at Bengaluru or Mumbai for that matter!\nWhat I ordered , exactly 2 items,both of which were disappointing -\n\nDahi puri-2/10(there was no stuffing in the Puri, just boondi and curd)\n\nDahi papdi chaat -4/10\nThe sev used or the boondi, something was smelling of oil gone bad/stale!\n\nSo overall it was a disappointing experience, I would recommend you to go,at your own risk!!",
