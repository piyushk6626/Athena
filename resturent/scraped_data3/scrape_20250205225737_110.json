Thankfully, It was realized before we served the guests who do not consume the same. still made for a very uncomfortable environment.\nRaised a grievence through through the app, and they connected us on a conference call. the person from the hotel decided to hang up mid conversation. A very sad response.\nPls check on what you send to your customers pls!",

Their appam and Kerala parotta are my absolute favorites, always soft and perfectly made. I can't resist most of the food, the rich flavors of curry leaves in their tawa fry bangad Or the Kerala chicken fry, absolutely yummy!  Their biryani is also a standout! Every dish brings the taste of Kerala right to my table, making it a must-try for anyone craving genuine, flavorful Malabar cuisine. When at Malli Republic don't forget to try the lemon tea!",
