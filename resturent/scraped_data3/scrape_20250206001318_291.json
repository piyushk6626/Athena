A lovely surprise was the complimentary lemongrass tea and a fun DIY paan—such a unique touch! The food and drinks were outstanding, every bite was perfection. Definitely a 10/10 for ambiance, food, and service. Can’t wait to visit again",

They guided us through the dishes and provided excellent service. I remember eating a chili, and the waiter immediately brought water, refilled my glass, and checked to make sure I was okay.\n\nAs for the food, it was satisfying. We were quite full just from the starters—sushi and dumplings—so the portions are generous. In terms of quality, there’s room for improvement if you’re comparing it to high-end Asian restaurants. The mocktails weren’t particularly impressive, but perhaps we didn’t order the best ones. Overall, I would definitely return and recommend others to visit as well.",

This pan asian restaurant is two to three shops away from Naturals. We went inside with very less expectation but we were quite impressed by the decor. It is not a huge place but has a nice cozy environment. We ordered veg springs rolls and noodles. We were told that cocktail for male guests was on the house. Yes you read it right. Another surprise was the Spinach pan which was also complimentary. The Spinach pan is a noble idea with exciting spread of tamarind paste. Veg spring role was amazing and so was the noodles. We liked the presentation, portion and taste. Price was slightly on higher side. The place serves alcohol. It is very accessible and can be a good option if you feel to enjoy asian cuisine.",
