However, the service was very slow, every dish we ordered took over 25 minutes to arrive, the staff said that they had a private function the next day so they were busy with the prep of that. The Thai curry was pathetic, it tasted like chutney with lemon grass. The dessert was a bebinca which didnâ€™t have the right consistency. The staff were quite friendly too.",

The food here is mix mostly mains are dry options .\nXacuti rice with poi- xacuti was tasty we repeated it too.\nChicken Thai Curry green rice- was the best I ever had boneless chicken with a stint of spicy flavour. And  fish platter which had all types of fishes cooked in different styles.\nWe also tried chicken mango and crispy Chicken (fresh chicken with crispy fried ) we repeated it multiple times.\nWe had moctials too which were cool too.\nWould rate the place 4 out of 5 , the place is good prices are a bit on the higher side for the quantity service was a bit slow, but I would recommend the place. ðŸ‘Œ",
