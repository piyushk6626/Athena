The staff are friendly and the service is excellent.\n\nThe restaurant has two floors and we sat on the top floor as the bottom was fully occupied. We ordered Mix Bhaji Pao, samosa, and Special tea. Everything was delicious.\n\nThe Special Tea was strong and reminded me of Navtara cups with Bhonsle Tea ðŸ˜›. Overall, a great experience",
