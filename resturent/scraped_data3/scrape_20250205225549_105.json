The soft and sweet music created an incredible ambiance‚Äîa perfect Goa welcome.\n\nThe staff was exceptionally helpful, guiding us through the menu with suggestions that were spot on. They even recommended visiting a fantastic new bar called JUNA after dinner, which turned out to be a great tip!\n\nThe freshness of the dishes truly stood out, leaving us humbled and craving more. Every bite was a testament to the care and quality they put into their food.\n\nHighly recommend Sakana for anyone looking for a memorable dining experience in Goa. We‚Äôll definitely be coming back!",

The overall ambiance strikes a perfect balance, neither too hot nor too cold, ensuring a pleasant dining experience. If you're a fan of delicious Tempura üç§, you'll definitely appreciate it here. The service is outstanding, with incredibly friendly and helpful staff who offer suggestions and guidance if you're having trouble deciding on a starter. The restaurant is well-maintained and spotlessly clean, adding to the overall inviting atmosphere that it exudes.",
