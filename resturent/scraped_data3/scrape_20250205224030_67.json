The staff was friendly and attentive, making great recommendations for dishes based on our preferences.\n\nWe started with the dim sum and sushi, which were absolutely fresh and flavorful. For the mains, we tried their signature wok-fried noodles and Thai curry – both dishes were packed with authentic flavors and beautifully presented. The portion sizes were generous, perfect for sharing, and the ingredients tasted incredibly fresh.\n\nWhat really stood out was the attention to detail in every dish. It’s clear they care about quality and authenticity in their Asian cuisine. Prices were reasonable considering the quality and ambiance. Overall, Wok n Roll is a must-visit for anyone in Goa looking to enjoy delicious Asian food in a stylish, comfortable setting. Highly recommend and can’t wait to come back!",

We tried one of  the best prawn baos  in town. I’m highlighting this after having tried paces such as The Second House, Whispering house, Daddios, The Sanctuary to name a few.",
