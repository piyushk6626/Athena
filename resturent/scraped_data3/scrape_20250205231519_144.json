It's 30+ years of history keeps it in good company which its peers have readily abandoned to cater to guests who don't care much for the rich & diverse local cultures, tastes & music fare.\nThe restaurant decor is very vintage & exquisite. For the vibe and the ambience this restaurant has to offer, the food & drinks are competitively priced and tasty. The staff is cordial & quick in its service.\nThe owner makes it a point to interact with the guests & is eager to attend to them.\nVisit for a relaxed evening for some great food, drinks & music that is not loud or garish.",
