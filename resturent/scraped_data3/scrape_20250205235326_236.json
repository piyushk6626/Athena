The customers who visit here are almost worst. They even give a long listing of ingredients and explain the whole preparation while other customers have to watch their mouth and sit. Today one lady took 20minutes and more just to explain a dish along with prep. Got so pissed off. After taking the order too, they took another 20minutes. Total 40minutes of sitting simply for nothing. Stepping out of the hotel and I am posting this review.\nThose who are hungry, pls don't come here",
