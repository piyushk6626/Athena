The breakfast buffet is simply wow! Its a poolside restaurant that has a snooker table as well. Full entertainment and taste too!",

We asked if it was possible to use the pool in the day time & came back the following day. For just 200 per person you can access the pool in the sunshine, sun loungers with provided towels, & order from the restaurant all day! It was such a treat sunbathing, drinking & eating around the pool. I was surprised we were the only 2 people there. All the staff were very kind and helpful plus the food was delicious! All round amazing, whether you’re eating at the restaurant or just visiting the pool.\n\nSide note: the pool area is completely shaded by 3pm.",

The restaurant’s atmosphere was fantastic, and the staff was incredibly welcoming. They patiently guided us with food choices and served everything with a warm smile. A big kudos to the management team for their thoughtful service—they even prepared plain baby food for my daughter, and she loved it, finishing the whole bowl! Truly one of the best family restaurants in Goa. Highly recommended!",
