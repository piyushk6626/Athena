Smoking is only allowed outside as you can guess.\nHowever I have given it 3 star for a particular reason, the menu is very limited, only Thali based, not much variety is there.\nThey call it a thali and charge decent amount of 300 to 450 but all foods are limited quantity. The wooden plate and bowls look good but the curry quantity was very less, on asking for some extra curry they said everything is limited and we had to order extra bowl of rice and sambar. Taste was okayish , nothing extraordinary.\nThere was a guy who was well mannered and asked our preferences on how we'd like the drinks. on the other the waitress was too inexperinced and didnt even give plates and glasses before serving food and drinks.\n\nEnough Parking is available on the road for both four and two wheelers, however the side of the entrance is a garbage dump !! See for yourself in the video.",

Definitely visit this place if you are travelling to GOA.\nOverall rating is 08/10\nThe bill is somewhat on costlier side and if we need some more chutney it is also chargeable which is quite surprising but the tiffins we ordered Dosa and Vada tastes are very good.",
