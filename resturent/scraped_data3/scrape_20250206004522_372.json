There were not much options because of fish availability. We got started with prawns and bangda  fry with kingfish thali and chicken xachuti thali. Food and drinks prices are reasonable with good quantity. Thali has several side dishes which make it worth trying. One should definitely try the food here, it is sure worth your money.",

The dishes we ordered were unappetizing and tasted terrible. The portions were small, and the prices were exorbitant.\n\nThe service was equally unimpressive. Our server seemed disinterested, and requests for refills or extra condiments took an eternity to arrive.\n\nOverall, my experience at River lounge  was a complete waste of money. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.\n\n*Rating Breakdown:*\n\n- Food Quality: 1/5\n- Service: 1/5\n- Value for Money: 1/5\n- Ambiance: 1/5\n\n*Will I Return?:* No\nOwner is also arogant and wrong words using against the customer",

The food was an insult to culinary arts - overpriced, underseasoned, and presented with all the finesse of a kindergarten craft project.\n\nService? What service? Our server seemed to be suffering from acute apathy, taking an eternity to take orders and forgetting one of them altogether.\n\nAmbiance? Think dingy, dated decor and a lingering aroma of stale grease.\n\nThe manager's response to our complaints? Crickets.\n\n*DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE.* This restaurant's sole purpose seems to be separating unsuspecting patrons from their hard-earned cash.\n\n*Ratings:*\n\n- Food: 0/5 (inedible)\n- Service: 0/5 (non-existent)\n- Value: 0/5 (highway robbery)\n- Ambiance: 0/5 (dumpster fire)\n\n*Will I Return?:* When hell freezes over.\n\n*Warning:* Save your taste buds, wallet, and sanity. Steer clear of this dump.",
