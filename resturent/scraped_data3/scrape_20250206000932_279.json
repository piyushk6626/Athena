Don't expect too much about decor, ambience, cutlery, music, fancy seating.\nThe vibe is going to be about beer and cold drink crates lying around, a few dogs loitering around, wooden benches and tables, asbestos roofing, dim lighting and zero views. Just focus on the meals and gupshup. This is a typical small time family Goan eatery setup, a popular local haunt. The restaurant is literally in the family bungalow frontyard! Street parking is ample.\nService is quick, quantity is huge and meals are fresh and delicious. That's all that matters here.\nTry their fresh fish Rawa fry, local fish is a favourite here like Chonak, Modso, Tamso, Mandke, Veliyo.\nWe paid Rs.1400 for a huge crispy rawa fried Modso plate and rawa fried Squid Mandke for two people, which is on the higher side, but it was absolutely yum. Have been visiting this place for past eight years. They have gradually increased their prices, used to be a budget place. There was so much food left, I had to parcel it up.",

The curry is flavourful and spicy. The seafood fresh and generous. My find in the latest trip to goa. The chonak the modso were fresh and tasty but the prawns, the prawns are big and the fried prawn portion is more than generous.",
