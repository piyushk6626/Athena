            "review_text": "I recently visited Rio Cafe and tried their Veg Club Sandwich, Cold Chocolate, and Pizza, and I was thoroughly impressed.\n\nThe Veg Club Sandwich was fresh and flavorful. The layers of crisp vegetables, cheese, and a light spread created a perfect balance. The bread was toasted just right, adding a satisfying crunch. It was hearty and filling, making it a great option for a light meal or a quick bite.\n\nThe Cold Chocolate was a delightful treat. It was rich, creamy, and perfectly chilled. Not overly sweet, it had the right blend of chocolate and milk, making it a refreshing drink to complement the meal. The presentation was also visually appealing, with a drizzle of chocolate on top.\n\nAs for the Pizza, it was a solid offering. The crust was thin and crispy, with a nice chewiness in the center. The toppings were fresh and generously spread, though I would have preferred a bit more seasoning. However, the cheese was gooey and delicious, which made up for any minor flaws. Itâ€™s a decent choice if youâ€™re craving a classic pizza.\n\nOverall, Rio cafe offers a cozy atmosphere and tasty food. Whether youâ€™re looking for a quick snack or a leisurely meal, this spot is worth visiting.",
