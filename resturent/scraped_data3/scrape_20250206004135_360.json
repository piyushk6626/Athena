I told them I would pay them in the morning as the roads are dangerous to walk at night. They wouldn't accept and I asked for the police to be called as it was their fault. As I didn't want hassle i paid for cab to atm. The food was like dog food and they overcharged me as I'm foreign like everywhere In India that's why there's no tourists. Avoid at all costs.",
