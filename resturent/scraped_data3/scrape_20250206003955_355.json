The dosas and vadas were exceptional, with perfect texture and flavors that felt truly traditional. The soothing background music made the short 7-10 minute wait for the food quite enjoyable. However, the beverages were just average and could use some improvement. Overall, a great spot for authentic South Indian flavors with a calm and welcoming vibe!",

It’s a vibe being here and I am in food coma right now after eating such a delicious meal. Must try the thali here also this is my 2nd time here and the first time I had ghee roast dosa which was amazing and that’s when I decide to go here again. But this time I tired thali and it was wow.",
