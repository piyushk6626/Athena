The Goan style fish appetiser was a delight. Potato chips, just like we wanted with a homemade spicy green chutney. The server (didn’t get his name) was friendly and very attentive. The best thing is the cats and dogs around the place, if you want only then they will come to you. It was lovely to have a wholesome meal in this place.",
