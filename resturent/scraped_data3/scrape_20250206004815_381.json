However, the high prices can be a bit of a turn-off. Great for a one-time visit if youâ€™re looking for a picturesque setting, but not the most budget-friendly option.",

Food is Good, Service is the best. Good Music, what else one need to enjoy the evening. Staff is very friendly and cooperative as they replaced one of our ordered dishes because of salty taste. Must visit cafe on Anjuna.",
