            "review_text": "Cookies Bar N Restaurant is a great place tbt. The food is good and the portion sizes are sufficient to fill you up. The portions are mostly for 1-person but if you're ordering multiple dishes you can surely share and the taste of it is also really good.\n\nI haven't tried the seafood or Goan here but mostly North Indian dishes and Breakfast served are really great. It energizes your body and is quite fulfilling too. Surely a place to visit for good food in Goa.\n\nAt first, you'll think it's just a normal place with normal food where they don't care about quality but it's nothing like that. Even if the place is empty they'll serve you some insanely good food. If you're nearby and hungry, this place is surely for you.\n\nAdditionally, with the food being food you also get a free dog who just sits there and asks for loads of pets and her name is Lucy. So make sure to pet her always.",
