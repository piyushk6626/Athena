            "review_text": "Late-Night Delight at Country Kitchen, Anjuna, Bardez ‚Äì Goa‚Äôs Hidden Gem!\n\nIf you‚Äôre wandering the lively streets of Anjuna Beach in Goa, looking for a place that serves hot, delicious food even late at night, look no further than Country Kitchen. Our experience here was nothing short of exceptional, and it deserves every bit of a 5-star review!\n\nIt was around 1 AM when we stumbled upon this cozy spot while soaking in the joyful vibes of Anjuna Beach. Despite the late hour, the team at Country Kitchen welcomed us warmly and served us fresh, piping hot food that hit all the right notes. The roti was perfectly soft, paired with a creamy, flavorful paneer dish that was nothing short of heavenly. We also ordered a hearty soup that added warmth to the breezy Goan night. To elevate the experience, we paired it with Breezer cranberry flavor, which perfectly complemented the meal and gave it a refreshing twist.\n\nThe service was just as impressive as the food. The staff went out of their way to ensure we had a great experience, serving us everything with a smile. It‚Äôs rare to find such dedication at this hour, and their hospitality truly stood out.\n\nWhat makes Country Kitchen even more special is its strategic location near the iconic Anjuna Beach. Whether you‚Äôre out exploring the beach or simply in the mood for a late-night food hunt, this place is a must-visit.\n\nFor anyone in Bardez, Goa, this is a spot you shouldn‚Äôt miss. Great food, great vibes, and great service‚ÄîCountry Kitchen has it all! Highly recommended for foodies and night owls exploring Goa.",
