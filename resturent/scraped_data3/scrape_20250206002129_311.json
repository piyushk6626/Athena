With the huge row of cars parked here, I assumed that it is an upscale restaurant, but the moment I entered I realised it is a budget restaurant serving local food. After running through the menu we decided to have chonak fish thali and a chonak serving.  The fish was fresh and fried to perfection, though the portion was smaller than normally served in other restaurants. The curry is on the spicy side and flavoursome, however no substantial presence of seafood. Overall I was satisfied with the food. Easy on the pocket too.",
