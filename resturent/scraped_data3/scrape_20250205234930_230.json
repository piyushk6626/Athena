Service was fast during less crowded(i am not sure about when the crowd is more or moderate).\n\nBackside parking is available.",

You can also ask that shack's stuff to book any deck chair for morning.\nFood quality is okay. Time of waiting for food is about 20-30 minutes but for some position it can take more time. Waiters don't warn about time of waiting that's why I recommend to ask them about it.\nThey don't have ground coffe, only Nescafe.\nAlso I would recommend to instruct waiters about order of bringing food and drinks because by default they bring any drinks first and then food.",
