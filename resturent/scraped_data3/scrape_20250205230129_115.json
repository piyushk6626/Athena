The bathrooms are clean and hygienic, which is always a plus. While the service can be on the slower side for food (drinks come out quickly), it’s Goa — you’re here to drink, relax, and unwind! I’ve seen people sit here for hours nursing one drink (but that doesn’t mean you should misuse it). It’s located in a more secluded part of the beach, making it less crowded, and they even have a small library. Definitely worth visiting!",

A little expensive but good food when combined with the beach side seating.\nService is a little slow but friendly. Overall a great place for a secluded yet public vibe with beach side views.",

The Jungle Juice cocktails were a delightful treat, bursting with flavor and truly exceptional. The ambiance was nothing short of impressive, offering a serene atmosphere that becomes even more breathtaking as the sun rises. The staff, including the owner, were incredibly welcoming and attentive, always ready with excellent food recommendations. The addition of a billiards table provided a fun and social element, allowing guests to unwind while making lasting connections. A truly remarkable experience overall!",
