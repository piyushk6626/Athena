The menu offered a variety of dishes, including garlic naan, butter roti, palak paneer, aloo gobi, maharaja chicken, and chicken biryani, all of which were flavorful and freshly prepared. The orange and pineapple juices were refreshing and complemented the meal perfectly.\n\nA special mention goes to Anand, our waiter, whose friendly and attentive service made the experience even more enjoyable. He ensured that everything was served promptly and with a smile.",
