He understood the needs and suggested some specialities which were too tasty. Their fish varieties were so fresh and yummy (esp. the Goan Rechado masala fry). The breakfast served here is pretty decent and has a range of to-order menu apart from the default buffet (poha and pan bhaji are good from the buffet). People who work at this restaurant has a good sense of hospitality.\n\nOverall, a good restaurant with a decent ambience.",
