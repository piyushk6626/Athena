Roti/ Chapati were hard and not as expected.\n\nService was not so good for us in comparison to how other guests were welcomed and guided for seating. It may be due to the shortage of staff, don't know.\n\nThe best thing for our visit was the ambience of the restaurant, it's very well decorated with quotes all around the walls and you would spend much of your time reading it.",

Other food joints around serve better food at better prices\n4) overpriced",
