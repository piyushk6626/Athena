Service was a little poor back then, and it's even worse now. I could see they were very hospitable to foreigners and treated Indians and local Goans as if they didn't exist.  The boss lady/female who sits at the counter was quite rude.  We had family with elderly members and asked her to set up several extra chairs. She argued initially, shook her head, ignored, and didn't bother to inform any server. We waited pretty long time for someone to make the arrangements, but eventually did it on our own. On the other hand, we could see serving staff rushing behind foreign clients to service.\nAgain, following the chair scenario, no one showed up to take orders for about 45 minutes. We returned to the counter to place one. Horrible horrible service and the place was not even crowded for the servers to be busy. For some reason, the male boss this time was quiet and did not provide much assistance.  The restaurant needs to improve its service and be more respectful towards locals.",

Such people dont deserve to be in the hospitality industry that too in a vibrant and lovely place like Goa. Places like this bring a bad name to the whole beach place.",
