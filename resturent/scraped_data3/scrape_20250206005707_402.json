The place is compact, small and cozy but Saanvi who runs this place along with her family has a very big heart. She is the main cook behind the amazing Fish Thalis and all the Goan style authentic dishes.\n\nThis place also serves superb starters like Chicken Crispy, lollipop.\n\nWe tried and recommend\nChonak Fish Thali - 290/-\nPrawns rawa fry - 300/-\nReshado Bangdo - 140/-\nChicken crispy - 200/-\n\nYou can relax, chill and take the balcony seat, enjoy the view and mouth watering dishes.\n\nSpecial mention to Saavi‚Äôs Bangdyache or mackerel hooman/curry. Loved the way it was prepared, very authentic and exactly how a mackerel curry should be with Tefla, ginger, garlic pieces.",

You get a nice view of Mandovi River while having your food, do try visiting over day time to enjoy the river view.\n\nSecondly the food, oh my god it is super yum and the pricing is super affordable.\n\nThings I ordered.\nButter garlic Squid\nPrawns masala fry\nFish thali.\n\nSquid was yum, the sauce in which it was prepared was üòã. One should definitely try it.\n\nThe prawns fry were to die for, the size of the prawns were huge and the taste was too good.\n\nLastly we had the fish thali. All the items on the fish thali were packed with taste and freshness.\n\nThe staff of Aapas were super friendly, warm and surely goa felt like home.\n\nA highly recommended place. Please visit this place when in Panjim.‚ù§Ô∏è",
