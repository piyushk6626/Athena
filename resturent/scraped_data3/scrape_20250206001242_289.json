It was delicious.\n\nSomehow Peopleâ€™s Goa brewing lager did not appeal to my senses.\n\nOrder took considerable amount of time, as expected, as it comes from wooden oven to your plate.\n\nParking is bit difficult as we parked our car just brushing the restaurant adjacent to the bustling Anjuna Mapusa road.",

It is a well lit place with good ambiance.\nThe open kitchen is helpful..the place is filled with aroma of cooking food.\nTheir Caesars salad is tasty.\nYes it is slightly on costlier side..but once a while spending evening here is worth it.\n\nOnly thing disgusting was the overflowing water near the washroom. Take care of it and it is a merry place to hangout.",
