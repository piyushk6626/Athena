Sometimes you get the main course before the starters ü§£ , or you might get the main course and not get the naans at all üòù . Still the food quality is good and let's be honest the rates are great given that it's goa üòÄ.",

The order takes quite a lot of time although twice I've gotten the order pretty quickly.\n\nFood I recommend :\nCheese Garlic Naan\nChicken Manchow Soup\nChicken Garlic\nChicken Afghani\nButter Chicken\nDragon Chicken\n\nAvoid the Chicken Biriyani",

Chinese is nothing special but okay if you're alone and want a small serving. Shawarma maybe available depending on the time. Go for meat one if you're ordering. Mutton was not good, comparing to other places. Shakes are often served thin so mention before hand if you like thick chocolate shakes.",
