They took 45 mins to bring the butter garlic prawns and it was absolutely tasteless. Like there was no salt in it and they were so dry.  The red sauce pasta had the taste of raw carrots in it. Also, earlier I had asked the price of people's beer at the bar and he said it's for Rs 200 but in the bill they charged me Rs 350 for it and then I had to ask them to revise and get the bill. Overpriced place and not worth it.",

We had a delightful meal, including jeera rice, paneer butter masala, and bread beer. The service was excellent, and we absolutely love this spot. It's definitely a must-visit when you're in North Goa.",
