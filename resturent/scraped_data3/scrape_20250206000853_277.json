            "review_text": "The culinary experience at this establishment is truly outstanding, complemented by a delightful ambiance featuring an eclectic EDM soundtrack. However, it's essential to consider the pricing structure, which leans towards the higher end. The cost of both food and beverages, alongside the notably expensive hookah, coupled with a 10% service charge, contributes to a substantial overall expense.\n\nDespite the financial aspect, the service remains a highlight, delivering commendable attention and efficiency. During our visit on a somber day, the restaurant appeared sparsely populated, perhaps reflective of the circumstances. Nevertheless, one can anticipate a livelier atmosphere during regular operating hours, likely attracting a more bustling crowd.\n\nMy order, comprising three beverages, a serving of French fries, and nachos, resulted in a total bill of 6000₹. This expenditure reflects the relatively high pricing at this establishment. While the quality of the items ordered was commendable, potential patrons should be mindful of the overall cost when considering a visit.",

The service was outstanding, this kind of service I haven’t seen anywhere in Goa.\nI’ve been to lots of cafes and restaurants in Goa during my trip, but this is the best!! We attended a DJ Chetas event, the owner was super super helpful and got us a table and THEY HAVE JAIN OPTIONS, the owner was also Jain, they have so so many jain items compared to other places I have been to.\nThe vibes are amazing, beautiful sunrise and sunset parties. Must visit!!",
