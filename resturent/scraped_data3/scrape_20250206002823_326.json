            "review_text": "During my stay at Planet Hollywood Resort, I visited Poseidon's Cove Beach Grill three times over four days. The location, overlooking the beach, was fantastic, providing a perfect ambiance for a relaxing meal. The food and service were consistently excellent, meeting the high standards expected of a 5-star establishment. We celebrated our kids birthday there and they made all efforts to give us a great experience.\n\nHowever, I was disappointed with the very limited menu choices. While everything we tried was delicious, the lack of variety was noticeable, especially after multiple visits. Additionally, the prices were quite high, even considering the 5-star setting.\n\nOverall, Poseidon's Cove Beach Grill offers a great dining experience in terms of location, food, and service, but it would benefit from a more extensive menu, cleaner toilet  and slightly more reasonable pricing.",

So we all ordered whatever each one wanted but to be honest all the dishes were soooo salty and more over the burgers and the wrap… they all left it with just one bite … but still they charged me for that salty food and I also forgot to mention the burgers were not done as per the description, items were missing, like beef steak pieces were not in. I would not recommend anyone to go out there. But if your’ll want it’s upto you guys.",
