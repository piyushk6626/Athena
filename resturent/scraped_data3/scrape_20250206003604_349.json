We went for fish cutlets for starters, and the beef tongue, really nice. And the amazing prawns curry rice, amazing. The prices are good and the service very nice and kind. They have some good beers too. White Owl, yeah! And some liquors on the menu too.\nIt goes straigh to our list of favourite restaurants in Goa!",

It has a  beautiful, unobstructed sea view and the breeze that comes with it. It can be best described as a much needed low key food haven away from the crowded city.\n\nThe food at White House is authentically home made and every morsel bursts with flavour. The menu is not extensive and every dish that leaves the kitchen is spot on. Trust me, I've tasted everything on the menu. My all time favorites include the fried calvam, the beef croquettes, the fish cutlets, the boiled goan chorizo and the chicken cafreal. As for the cost, it is very affordable.\n\nIf you're looking for a hearty meal, good view, excellent ambiance music and a quiet evening this is the place for you.",
