            "review_text": "Lovely restaurant with upscale beach vibes. Perfect for a sunset dinner, this restaurant seeks to reimagine not replicate pan-Asian cuisine. We visited twice and thoroughly enjoyed over 10 different dishes - all were excellent! I particularly enjoyed their subtle twist on a Pad Thai (with that approach being replicated across many of the dishes).\n\nI'd also call out the amazing service that we experienced here across both nights. Miss Kiran was friendly, attentive, and thoughtful. Everyone else was equally professional, adding to an overall memorable experience.\n\nHighly recommend to all W guests, or those looking for a distinguished evening.",

The mushroom starter was a great suggestion from the staff, and the green Thai curry and honey-glazed lotus stem were on point. However, the dumplings could have used a bit more flavor, and the Balinese pomfret wasn't as fresh as expected. overall had a pleasant experience.",

Its very kid friendly.The prawns dish was undoubtedly superb! However, the beef dish let me down.\n\nNevertheless the experience was good, though the price was on the extreme high side.\n\nService is fantastic. But the entry is bit awkward. They dont allow the car go inside near to restaurant and also we have to share our id with security as its their protocol. Strange!\n\nOverall, a good experience.",
