            "review_text": "Susegad is an unassuming food truck located right across from Corporation Bank near St. Michael Church in Anjuna, but don't let its modest appearance fool you. I found this place after seeing a reel on Instagram, and although I was initially skeptical, the food completely exceeded my expectations. The menu is straightforward, yet the flavors are anything but.\n\nThe dishes are crafted with care, offering a truly satisfying experience. Whether you're looking for a quick bite or something more filling, you'll find the food here incredibly tasty. The seasoning, freshness of ingredients, and attention to detail in each dish reflect a dedication to quality that’s rare to find in food trucks.\n\nThe charm of Susegad lies in its ability to deliver such rich flavors in a casual setting, making it a fantastic spot for both tourists and locals. If you're in Anjuna, this is a must-visit for anyone looking to enjoy a hearty meal without the formality of a restaurant. Despite my initial skepticism, Susegad turned out to be a highlight of my trip, proving that sometimes, the best food comes from the most unexpected places.",
