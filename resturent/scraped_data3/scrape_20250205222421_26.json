However, the place tends to get crowded, so arriving early is recommended to fully enjoy the experience.\n\nWhile the overall ambience and flavours are excellent, the service could use some improvement. At times, the staff seem inattentive, and a quicker, more efficient service would enhance the dining experience.\n\nThat said, the quality of the food and reasonable prices make it well worth the visit. If youâ€™re a fan of local delights, this place is highly recommended!",

I think it has to do more with the name and the location.\n\nCustomers are that many that waiters will make sure they take your order fast without investing in a more friendly environment. I felt as if I was in those Mumbai restaurants in which you eat and leave, rather the enjoying the whole experience of it.\n\nThough food was not bad, I don't think it was great considering the rates. This place was not for me.",

The ambience here was great and the restrooms were clean. Ample parking space available right next to the restaurant in an empty plot. The restaurant has a separate bar section with good music and seating. The food was tasty and fulfilling. Ghee rice, Chicken Tikka and Chicken Lollipops were great. The Goan Fish thali was tasty and filling as well.",
