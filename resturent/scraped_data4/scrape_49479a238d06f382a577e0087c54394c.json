Tried their thai curry and rice bursting with south east asian flavours. The staff is courteous and does an exceptional job at making your visit worth it. They have live music too and the thought on the volume levels is just admirable.",

Everyone knows everyone, and welcomes you in with so much warmth and openness!\n\nBelinda, (the owner, and bar tender) is a lovely human and dishes up some amazing cocktails!\n\nAnd Smriti sang some lovely songs that had all of us grooving!\n\nThey have live music on Tuesdays, Fridays and Sundays and karaoke on Saturdays - so do come on one of those days for a lively and fun night out!!",
