The food prices and the quality as well as the quantity is worth it. We also had the Mussels rava fry and the squids in butter garlic which was delicious. For desserts, we had the seradura which is lovely and is served in a cute glass jar. Its a great place for a family outing. The service is also quite prompt. Must visit",
