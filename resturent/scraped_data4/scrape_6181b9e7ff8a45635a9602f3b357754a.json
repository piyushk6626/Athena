Coming to the food, we had the Sausage Rolls, Beef Croquettes, and Prawn Pattys and the King Fish Rava Fry, all of them tasted good, but the standout dish was the Sausage Rolls. Pricing is very much value for money and the service can be improved on. Definitely check this place out, as it's one of the few places in Goa that serves quality food.",

If your waiter is busy the other waiter will not even take your order. By the time our fish fry arrived (which was rolled up) we finished our beer. They are biased towards their regular customers over tourists.",

Wow the food is so cheap and so tasty here that you must visit this place to eat and finger lick. The fish curry rice, the prawn fry, the fish fry, the drinks are dead cheap here and so is the food. Yummy!!! The place is crowded and there is waiting period. All the staff are very courteous and do advise you as well on the type of food and drink. The service is super quick. a must visit for sure",
