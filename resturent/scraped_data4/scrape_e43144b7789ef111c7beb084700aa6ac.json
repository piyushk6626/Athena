The food is great and tasty, their burger looks basic by the look but if you take a bite out of it, it's very tasty with the patty being crispy, yummy burger sauce, lettuce, onions and pickles! I love their Mexican fries, they are fries in Mexican sauce with pieces of chicken, pickles, olives, gratted cheese and other miscellaneous stuff. Overall a great place to come, also it is crowded at lunch times, many students come and eat here. Recommend!",

The prices are reasonable for the quality you're getting, which makes it a great spot for a satisfying meal. However, the biggest downside is the limited seating. The space is incredibly small, with only a few tables available, which can make dining here feel cramped and uncomfortable, especially during busy times. While the food definitely makes up for a lot, it would be great if they could expand the seating area to accommodate more customers. If you're okay with the tight quarters, though, it’s definitely worth a visit for the great food!",
