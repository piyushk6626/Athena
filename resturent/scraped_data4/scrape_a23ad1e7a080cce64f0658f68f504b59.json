The seating is slightly uncomfortable because the restaurant is placed on a slope but the food makes up for the discomfort. We got the non-veg thali and an extra dish- the calamari and chorizo. My fav on the thali was the chicken curry! Do go here because the food is great and the service is good .",

Definitely worth going here!\n\nThe Nonveg bengali thali platter was just awesome, whereas French cuisine was delicious. They have different types of great cocktails and healthy coolers.\n\nOverall, our experience at Mustard Cafe was decent, leaving us with a satisfying taste of both French and Bengali flavors.\n\nFood: 5/5\nService: 4/5\nAmbience: 4/5",
