You can see the lights of the shacks on Baga without having to deal with the creeps there. The service is impeccable, very welcoming and quick. Food was delectable and the entire place has a very nice vibe to it. Only downside is that it is a tad bit on the expensive side and the quantity of starters is too less. They also have lodging facilities.\nP.S. The chocolate milkshake is to die for.",
