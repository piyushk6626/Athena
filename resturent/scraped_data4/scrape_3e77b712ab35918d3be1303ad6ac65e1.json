We had chicken zacuti, mackerel fish fry and fish curry rice. It was mind blowing even though it was late.\n\nThe mackerel fry was insanely tasty and fresh and so Goan as well as fish curry and rice. Next day we came for lunch and ordered their famous fish Thali but we were disappointed coz the fish and prawn wasn’t that fresh. It was smelling and we know that it’s a smell comes when it’s not fresh. We get similar taste and smell when we have prawns in Bangalore. Overall i still recommend you folks to visit this place when you are in mandrem.\n\nHappy food hunting!!",
