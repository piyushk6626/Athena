The taste was amazing. The prawns curry we had with rice was also nice. Not great as I like my humann to be slightly on the spicier side. But many people do not want the spice. So that's okay! The waiter was also a very friendly chap named Prem who did not make us wait for too long even though it was the rush hour during lunch time. Overall a wonderful experience. Would definitely visit again! Keep up the good work Kuttikar restaurant team, please keep the quality same! Best wishes!",
