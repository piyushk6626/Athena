            "review_text": "I recently visited this cafe that had all the potential to be a great spot for a quick bite few years ago, but several issues made my experience quite disappointing this time.\n\nFirst, the customer service was below par. The waiters were constantly on their phones, even while attending to customers. This distracted behavior led to delays in taking orders and serving food. Additionally, there were visible arguments among the staff, which created a tense atmosphere. It was uncomfortable to witness the employees bickering while trying to enjoy my meal.\n\nTo make matters worse, the air conditioning unit was incredibly loud, making it hard to have a conversation. I hoped the waiters would address this, but they were often absent, forcing me to walk to the counter to get their attention. This lack of attentiveness added to the overall frustration.\n\nWhen it came to the food, the experience didn't improve much. I ordered the Honey Chilly Onion Rings, but they were disappointing. Instead of a balanced sweet and spicy flavor, they seemed to have just drizzled some random chili sauce over the rings, resulting in an odd and unpleasant taste.\n\nThe Classic Cold Coffee was another letdown. I was expecting a well-made cold coffee, but it turned out to be a Nescafe all-in-one frappe sachet. The flavor was mediocre at best and far from what I was hoping for in a cafe setting.\n\nHowever, not everything was bad. The Classic Burger was actually quite good. It was well-cooked, with a juicy patty and fresh toppings. If the rest of the food had been on par with the burger, my review might have been more positive.\n\nOverall, this cafe has potential, but it seriously needs to address its staff issues and improve the quality of its food offerings. Given my experience, I would not recommend this place to others unless they make some significant changes.",

The food was absolutely delicious - the pizza had a perfect crispy crust and tasty toppings, the burger was juicy and flavorful, and the fresh juices were vibrant. The staff were attentive and helpful.\nThey were friendly and efficient, creating a dining experience that was truly top-notch.",

Coffee is good. Freak shakes are nice but normal people can't finish. Overall a great place in panjim. Friends or date friendly.  Can use as a workspace also. Overall 3.5 on 5 stars rating. And also fancy place for photography.",
