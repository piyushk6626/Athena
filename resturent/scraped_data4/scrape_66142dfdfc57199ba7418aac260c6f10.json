The ambiance, however, was nice, and the prices were reasonable. One downside was that they packed the food in plastic instead of foil, which we didn’t expect, also i found couple of fly’s there near our food. While there’s definitely huge room for improvement, the visit was still satisfactory.",

However, we were disappointed to find that the staff refused to seat us, stating that they were closing early.\n\nWhile I understand that restaurants might need to wrap up operations ahead of the listed time, the lack of communication about this discrepancy left us feeling unwelcome. It would be helpful if the restaurant could update their closing time on Google or clarify their policies to avoid such misunderstandings.\n\nWe were looking forward to trying Cinnamon, but unfortunately, this experience left a sour note. I hope they can improve their customer service and communication in the future.",
