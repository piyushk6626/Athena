The scenery is truly one of the best Iâ€™ve experienced, and the peaceful atmosphere makes it an ideal escape from the crowds.\n\nHowever, there's one downside to note. The entrance from one side of the beach has been taken over by local restaurant owners, who require you to purchase food or drinks if you wish to enter from that route.  It feels a bit forced, especially if you're just looking to enjoy the beach without any obligation to buy something.\n\nDespite this, the beach itself remains a beautiful and serene destination. Just be mindful of which entrance you use, as the other entrances are more straightforward and don't have these restrictions. Still, I would highly recommend visiting this beach for its natural beauty and the incredible views!",
