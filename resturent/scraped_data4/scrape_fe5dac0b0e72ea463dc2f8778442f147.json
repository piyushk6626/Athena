Could have been removed earlier as well. Definitely a loss.\n\nWent here for lunch in a group of 10. The atmosphere was laid back as expected. Food was definitely good.\n\nA few items were taken off the menu. Surprisingly, they only had ice cream for dessert, so we skipped it.\n\nThe fried chicken was way too oily, and bland. It was so bad that we could not eat it.\nThe beef roast was my favourite. Damn tender.\n\nPlace was not crowded.\nThere was a nice breeze.\nWashrooms could use a cleaning.",
