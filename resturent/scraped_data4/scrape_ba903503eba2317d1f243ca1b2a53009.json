Happy to be here for the next time veg food options.\nPrawns fry was lip smacking.\nBut they closed the counter bit early like 10:45 PM is the last order time so kindly make note of it.\nOverall nice place to be with family n friends.",

            "review_text": "We were of 4 members from hyderabad and we got shocked to see the quantity of chicken served for rs350 rs450 which is way less than one can imagine. The gongura chicken pulav had oil overflowing. I understand gongura takes bit more oil than other leaves, but there are better ways to reduce oil. Spl Biryani was not that great for rs450 as per these reviews. There is no point of selling dishes at this price when there is no value added to them. Just because there are less andhra cousin options in goa doesn't mean it will never have. Please improve the quantity, lessen the price and oil. We wont come here again and will not recommend anyone. Makes me wonder if these reviews are real. We left utterly dissapointed and money wasted with half filled stomach. I suggest you all going to mana andhra ruchulu in calangute which is by far affordable and real.\n\nUpdate: reply to owner -\nThe reply shows your audacity. I have paid for the food you served us and you expect not to give any feedback? I would have surely shared this feedback if you had asked us on spot about the food. Hence I am recording it here. Grow up and learn to take a feedback amd improve yourself instead of asking me not to come again. Moreover I have already mentioned i wont come already.\n\nAll my reviews are my personal genuine feelings for what I have enjoyed or disliked (unlike the fake ones here). If you cant handle such reviews, better unlist yourself from Google maps. It will help genuine people like us to avoid places like this. I guess its high time to see trend of your reviews/feedback rather than checking the trend of your customer's timeline.\n\nI have updated 2 stars from 1 star just to spread some positivity.",
