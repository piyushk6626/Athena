Taste is ok ok I loved the quantity of chicken but there's a room for improvement. Veg noodles are very nice can try veg fried rice too, Gobhi munchurian was also nice the best part is the service its quick. And one nice tip I'll give you outside it's written chicken Biryani 120 but if you eat in the hotel upstairs it'll cost you 130 nothing much just for the infoðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚",
