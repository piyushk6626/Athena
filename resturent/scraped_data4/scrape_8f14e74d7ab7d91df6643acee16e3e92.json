The waiters ensured our comfort and needs were met, but in rush hours, you can find it difficult to contact them.\n\nThe ambience is the best thing in this restaurant. Live music adds cherry on the top along with the serene beauty and sound of the ocean.\n\nThe restaurant offers a stunning view of the ocean, making it an ideal spot for watching the breathtaking sunset.\n\nOverall a fantastic place to spend your evening. Definitely worth visiting again. It's highly recommended for a memorable dining experience.",

Every bite was packed with flavor and perfectly cooked.\n\nDrinks:\nThough we only had lime soda and lime water, both were refreshing and spot on.\n\nService:\nThe service was quick and efficient, and they ensured our comfort and needs were met.\n\nAmbience:\nThe ambience was a perfect getaway! The highlight of the night was the live one-man band music, which was simply amazing. The music was so captivating that I couldn’t resist dancing with my companion. Many other guests joined in, dancing and enjoying the vibe. There was even a brief karaoke session that night.\n\nThe restaurant also offers a stunning view of the ocean, making it an ideal spot for catching a breathtaking sunset.\n\nOverall:\nI absolutely loved this place! From the food to the atmosphere, everything was fantastic. It’s definitely worth visiting again. Highly recommended for a memorable dining experience.\n\nPS: better to reserve a table at the restaurant in advance.",
