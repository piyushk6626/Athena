The menu mostly english with some additions of Indian influence.  Placed order for English breakfast and eggs with avacado. To start with, the coffee is outstanding, had a milk one.  Eggs were well cooked and the ingredients were fresh. The watermelon juice was soothing. Overall a shack thought out to attract European tourists. Cutlery is good.  Furniture needs a definite upgrade but somehow does the work. The service women are very courteous and energetic and wave you a big thank you while leaving.",

The avocado/spinach egg dish was a highlight, featuring perfectly poached eggs and delicious homemade bacon.\nFish and Chips is a must Try.\nMary  and Pascoal, were vibrant and attentive, ensuring we had everything we needed and making us feel right at home.\n\nTo top it off, the prices were very reasonable. I highly recommend this spot and can't wait to come back.",

The cafe is popular for its Goan delicacies and traditional breakfast options.\n\nWe ordered Dinha’s Special Breakfast, Tuna Sandwich, and French Press Coffee. The Local Pancake (a mix of coconut and jaggery) was a delightful surprise, offering a unique flavor. The cafe was crowded during our visit, but the service was prompt, and the food quality was commendable. While the breakfast portions could be more generous for the price, the overall experience was enjoyable.\n\nIf you’re in Benaulim, this cafe is worth considering for a satisfying meal.",
