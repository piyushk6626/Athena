Located on Margao to Mangalore/ Karwar highway.\n\nThis is one of the best bars and restaurants on NH17 between Margao and Karwar. Located in a place called Demani in Cuncolim right beside the highway. Non Veg food is the speciality of the restaurant. If you are coming from Margao its around 1 km from the Cuncolim market on the left hand side. And if you are coming from Canacona it's after Cuncolim Police Station on RHS.\n\nExcellent place, super menu, quick service, and great prices. I'm happy to have stumbled into this place, and can‚Äôt recommend it enough. Go for it üëçüèºüëçüèº",

We tried the Triple Rice, Chowmin soup, Veg noodles, Masala Papad were equally impressive, providing a refreshing alternative to the usual boring roti. The staff and hotel operator were incredibly cooperative, adding to the pleasant dining atmosphere. If you're looking for delicious vegetarian food with excellent service, this restaurant is a top-notch choice. Highly recommended! üåü",
