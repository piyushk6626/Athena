Trisha, our server, was absolutely fantastic - friendly, attentive, and extremely professional. She made sure our glasses were always full and our plates were never empty. Her recommendations were spot on, and she even took the time to answer all our questions about the menu. The entire experience was seamless and enjoyable, thanks to Trisha's exceptional service. Highly recommend for a fantastic afternoon dining experience! 5/5 stars!\"",

Decor was bohemian and mostly white. There was live music in the evenings as well.\nBeautiful grounds for some lovely group family snaps.\nThis place is Perfect for a special family moment.",
