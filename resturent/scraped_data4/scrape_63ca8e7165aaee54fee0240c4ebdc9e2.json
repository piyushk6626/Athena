I would definitely recommend it.\n\n- Chicken Manchow Soup: It was okay, but nothing particularly memorable.\n\n- Paneer Mutter: The Paneer Mutter was also just okay, meeting basic expectations but not exceptional.\n\n- Online Order Experience:  On a separate occasion, I ordered Apple Chicken online. Unfortunately, the chicken pieces were not fresh and had an unpleasant smell, which was quite disappointing.\n\nOverall, a mixed experience with some decent dishes, but the ambiance and quality, particularly for online orders, could use improvement.",
