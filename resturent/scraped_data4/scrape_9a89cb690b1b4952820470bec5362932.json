The service was impressively quick, ensuring we never had to wait long for anything. The atmosphere was cool and inviting, making it a great spot to relax and enjoy a meal. Plus, the prices were very reasonable, especially considering the quality of the food. If you visit, don’t miss the coriander chicken—it’s a must-try! I can't recommend this place enough for anyone looking for a delightful dining experience.",

I am happy that I stumbled upon this restaurant.\n\nWe tried their signature thali among many other appetizers and all of it was lip smacking.\n\nFor me, this is only the start, I will not stop visiting this restaurant.",
