Don't judge a book by it's cover...\n\nA lovely place, we were fortunate to get a table even thou we just walked in, noticed that after a short while of our arrival they received many patrons.\n\nOn that unusually hot day , we were not really hungry for a full meal. Beer, a plate of fries, Chicken lolipop and Chicken Xacuti was ordered. Food was delicious, service was quick and efficient.\n\nNoticed, who I'm guessing is the owner, was walking around to the tables and making sure the patrons received their orders and were happy. No one walked up to us thou. Nonetheless, my parents were content.\n\nSomething that struck me was, when the bill arrived there was no taxes mentioned, guessing it must be added to their menu instead.\n\nOverall was a good experience in Panjim. A must visit. You should try some of the local food they have and also their drinks.",

The place has a warm, cozy vibe with a great ambiance that makes you feel right at home. The food is excellent, and I highly recommend exploring the prawns dishes.\n\nThe overall experience was fantastic. Whether you're going there for a meal or just for drinks, the quality and flavors are on point. If you're a football fan, you'll love the café's decor, which features posters and paintings celebrating the sport. It's a nice touch that adds to the overall charm of the place. If you're in the area, Godinho's Café is definitely worth a visit!",

Roasted pork was an excellent accompaniment to the drinks we had. On that note, do ask the price of the seasonal fish before you place an order!",
