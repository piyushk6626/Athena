First day for breakfast we waited for 1 hr than the time they told for the breakfast. We thought it's okay. Then when it comes to the dinner, we waited for more than 2 hours, when we ask them they said that today is their cleaning day, and finally give chicken curry only with the neck and other parts of chicken instead of chicken meat and only 2 Chappati per person only. While in our menu it was chilli chicken with ghee rice or fried rice and chappathi. We did get anything from the list. And the smell of chicken curry was terrible. For the 3 days package, we ate food completely from outside &  Tried goan foods. Better always prefer tour package without food.",
