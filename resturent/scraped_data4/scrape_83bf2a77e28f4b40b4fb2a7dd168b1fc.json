It offers a spacious setting with a great vibe, making it ideal for family visits and kid-friendly.\n\nWe tried a variety of seafood, and everything was delicious. The Prawns Tempura were top-notch, and the Pomfret Rawa Fry was good, but the Surmai Masala Tawa Fry and Tandoori Surmai were absolutely yum! We even ordered multiple servings of them.\n\nFor dessert, we tried the Caramel Custard—it was tasty but a bit too sweet for my liking.\n\nThe best part? All of this delicious food was surprisingly affordable. Though it’s a bit far to visit frequently, it’s definitely worth the try. Loved the experience!",

The ambience was too good and cool.\nWe had Squids masala fry as starter and Prawns curry rice with Reachado Mackrell.The taste of all the dishes takes u to heaven with the very first bite. Lastly we had Caramel pudding as sweet dish.\nThe service person was very kind, helpful and patiently explained abt the available dishes.  Highly recommend this place..",
