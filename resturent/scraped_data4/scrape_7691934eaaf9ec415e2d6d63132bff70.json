They have an indoor as well as an outdoor seating.\n\nThe cocktails & food are excellent and totally worth the price. A must visit, especially over weekends!",

They offer spacious ambience overlooking beautiful fields, delicious oriental food, cocktails, live music and much more\n\nWe tried their special bloody Mary prawns for starters and we totally loved the unique flavours it had. Next we had their Vietnamese chilli fish and I loved every bite of it. The chonak fish was fresh and flavourful.\nWe also tried their Indonesian fried rice which was sweet, tangy. The chicken steak had tender chicken pieces tossed in flavourful sauce.\nFor drinks we had fresh orange juice, pineapple juice and lemon soda. It was really chilled and refreshing\nFor deserts, I had chocolate ice cream. Beautifully served and tasted heavenly.\n\nThey also have a live bar serving unique cocktails and mocktails and their ambience spanning over 3 floors is perfect for parties!!\n\nThe food was presented beautifully and the quantity was really good. The staff were welcoming and friendly. A must try place for weekend getaways in north goa!!",
