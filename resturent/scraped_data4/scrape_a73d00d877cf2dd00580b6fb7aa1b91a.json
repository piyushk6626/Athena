We ordered the aubergine pizza, and it tasted heavenly.\n\nThe only complaint I have is that the service was slow; we had to repeat our orders to the waiters. We also tried the strawberry gelato, which was quite good as well.\n\nI will definitely visit again when I'm in Goa next time. This place is a must-visit for anyone who loves Italian food, especially pizza.",

The flavors were spot on, with a perfect balance of toppings and a crispy crust. The place has a calm, laid-back vibe, making it a great spot to relax after exploring. It's very popular with students, and I can see why – the food is fantastic, and the atmosphere is perfect for unwinding. Highly recommend it for anyone looking for great pizza in a chill environment. Definitely a place I’d visit again!",

I ordered two pizzas, including the delicious Four Cheese pizza, which was a perfect blend of flavors.\n\nThe Veg Lasagna was rich and comforting, bursting with fresh ingredients. To top it off, I enjoyed a Cosmopolitan cocktail that was expertly crafted.\n\nThe atmosphere was warm and inviting, and the service was top-notch. I highly recommend Da Tita for anyone craving authentic Italian cuisine!",
