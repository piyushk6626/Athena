No signs about “No smoking” anywhere in or outside the restaurant, we asked to speak to manager and she yelled from the bar to Us saying no smoking inside. Restaurant had only 2 tables of people and we were in a corner. Paneer took forever and was undercooked and raw masala. Useless  “Manager” Maggie was yapping away with another table, she saw that we were upset but didn’t attend to us to apologise or even address the situation. She had an attitude and was sarcastic, wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone only because of her.- no customer service skills. even took forever with our bill!\nRated this one star only because of Arselan. Great kid- and he deserves so much better- wishing him good luck.",
